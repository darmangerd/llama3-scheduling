The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\n\n        Rewritten text: ', ""Instruction: Rewrite the given text while keeping the same meaning.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\n\n        Rewritten text: ', ""Instruction: Rewrite the given text while keeping the same meaning.

It was too cold for September and I didn't want to wait longer.  After all, seven-sixteen am was probably too early to judge the weather.  The smell of autumn blended with the smell of roasted meat and free trade coffee from a distance.  I didn't want either of them.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\n', "" Deep Tissue Massage is a method that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

Second, we all have the same rights to the same things. Third, these things are not limited or controlled. The first principle does not mean we are all equally wealthy, since some are wealthier than others, and others are poorer. But the first principle is a statement of basic human rights; the second and third principles can be said to be the only way any resources or rights can be limited or controlled. The third principle was meant to address the question of who has access to which things. In fact, only people who have access to them are actually seen as possessing wealth. Fourth, it is acknowledged that there would be an abundance of consumer goods. But it is equally clear that there would be a shortage of many other things, even if there were so much that it was considered a good thing to not have anything. The fact is that we all have the same resources, and that we all have rights. So there is no need to keep things back, because that would be a waste of valuable resources. The same goes for food, water, and shelter. The last principle is acknowledged as a starting point. There will be no wealth until everyone has the same wealth. Wealth will become an object of status, and once we have lost that status, then it will no longer be worth our while to accumulate wealth. This means that resources will no longer be limited or controlled. In fact, limits and controls would be an infringement upon the basic rights and human rights that all are guaranteed.

Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness. 3. Rewritten text: 1.

The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\n\n        Rewritten text: ', ""Instruction: Rewrite the given text while keeping the same meaning.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\n\n        Rewritten text: ', ""Instruction: Rewrite the given text while keeping the same meaning.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught. Hopefully, this morning wouldn’t be an exception.\n\n        Rewritten text:  The woman who is the coffee maker to Starbucks coffee also has a cup of Starbucks’ own free trade coffee.

Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80.

This book is dedicated to them and their music.\n\n        The Doors was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965 by Jim Morrison (vocals), Ray Manzarek (keyboards), Robby Krieger (guitar), and John Densmore (drums). The band had an immediate impact on the rock scene, and they soon became one of the most popular bands in the world. The Doors have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time.\n\n        The Doors\' music has been described as psychedelic rock, with elements of blues, jazz, and classical music. The band was known for its use of the slide guitar, which Krieger played masterfully. The Doors also had a unique sound because of Morrison\'s poetic lyrics and Manzarek\'s organ playing.\n\n        The Doors\' first album, The Doors, was released in 1967. It featured the hit singles ""Light My Fire"" and ""The End."" The album was a huge success and helped to launch the band into stardom. The Doors went on to release several more successful albums, including Strange Days, Waiting for the Sun, and L.A. Woman.\n\n        In 1970, Morrison died from heart failure. The band continued to tour and record without him, but they never achieved the same level of success as they had before his death. The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. The band has been highly influential on rock music, and their legacy lives on today.']"§"['', '', "" Deep Tissue Massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment, repetitive motions, and past lingering injuries.

This book is dedicated to them and their music.\n\n        The Doors was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965 by Jim Morrison (vocals), Ray Manzarek (keyboards), Robby Krieger (guitar), and John Densmore (drums). The band had an immediate impact on the rock scene, and they soon became one of the most popular bands in the world. The Doors have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time.\n\n        The Doors\' music has been described as psychedelic rock, with elements of blues, jazz, and classical music. The band was known for its use of the slide guitar, which Krieger played masterfully. The Doors also had a unique sound because of Morrison\'s poetic lyrics and Manzarek\'s organ playing.\n\n        The Doors\' first album, The Doors, was released in 1967. It featured the hit singles ""Light My Fire"" and ""The End."" The album was a huge success and helped to launch the band into stardom. The Doors went on to release several more successful albums, including Strange Days, Waiting for the Sun, and L.A. Woman.\n\n        In 1970, Morrison died from heart failure. The band continued to tour and record without him, but they never achieved the same level of success as they had before his death. The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. The band has been highly influential on rock music, and their legacy lives on today.']"§{'rouge1_fmeasure': tensor(0.7350), 'rouge1_precision': tensor(0.6222), 'rouge1_recall': tensor(1.), 'rouge2_fmeasure': tensor(0.7339), 'rouge2_precision': tensor(0.6211), 'rouge2_recall': tensor(1.), 'rougeL_fmeasure': tensor(0.7350), 'rougeL_precision': tensor(0.6222), 'rougeL_recall': tensor(1.), 'rougeLsum_fmeasure': tensor(0.7350), 'rougeLsum_precision': tensor(0.6222), 'rougeLsum_recall': tensor(1.)}§1733007590.708057§1733007739.0577302§148.3496732711792§8

The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught. Hopefully, this morning wouldn’t be an exception.\n\n        Rewritten text:  I awoke at seven-sixteen a.m. and found the weather too frosty for September.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\n\n        Rewritten text: ', ""Instruction: Rewrite the given text while keeping the same meaning.

The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose.
