    "## Design of Experiments for Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to perform a systematic evaluation of different configurations of Llama 3 models using the principles of **Design of Experiments (DOE)**. The goal is to explore how various hyperparameter settings affect the performance of text generation tasks, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of each configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. **Parameter Exploration**: Evaluate multiple configurations by varying:\n",
    "   - Model sizes (e.g., 1B, 3B, 8B).\n",
    "   - Batch sizes for data processing.\n",
    "   - Maximum tokens generated per response.\n",
    "   - Quantization precision levels (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit).\n",
    "2. **Performance Metrics**: Measure the quality of the generated text using metrics like ROUGE.\n",
    "3. **Result Logging**: Store all results systematically in a CSV file for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**: Install necessary dependencies and configure CUDA for efficient computation.\n",
    "2. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing**: Prepare input text data and format it for the rewriting task.\n",
    "3. **Experimental Design**:\n",
    "   - Define a full-factorial experiment setup to evaluate all possible parameter combinations.\n",
    "   - Use a combination of models, batch sizes, token limits, and quantization settings to generate configurations.\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Load the specified model and tokenizer for each configuration.\n",
    "   - Tokenize input text and process it through the model.\n",
    "   - Generate outputs and compute evaluation metrics for the text.\n",
    "5. **Result Logging**: Save results, including performance metrics and timing information, into a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- A CSV file (`output.csv`) containing detailed information about each experiment, including:\n",
    "  - Model configuration.\n",
    "  - Generated outputs and their corresponding inputs.\n",
    "  - ROUGE scores for evaluating text quality.\n",
    "  - Execution times for each configuration."

Many low share of voice items will fall in this factual category.\",\n          \"Today, I will be discussing the proper way to make Starbucks beverages. It is important to note that many of the drinks can be prepared very quickly by dispensing them from insulated containers, such as the coffee and hot water thermals, and the iced coffee and tea dispensers. For many Starbucks customers, their interest tends to venture into more difficult-to-craft drinks. These difficult-to-craft drinks are like lattes. Lattes are important part of the Starbucks menu so it is pretty important to understand how they are made. In order to make a latte, you must first steam the milk. This is done by pouring the customer\\u2019s choice of milk into a silver, canister-like device, then inserting a heated rod that will blow steam into the milk. Be sure to insert only the tip at first, allowing it to heat only the surface, because you do not want to curdle the milk, and then lift the rod out a moment before plunging it all the way in. Doing this will prevent a, frankly, disturbing and loud noise that the machine will make if the rod is inserted directly into cold milk, so it is encouraged that we do it this way to prevent disturbing our customers and ourselves. And believe me, you do not want to hear that sound 100 times a day as you make lattes for customers, either. So, it is important to practice this technique and avoid that terrible noise.\\nNext, the thing to do once the milk is settled in and steaming, is to put in the customer\\u2019s choice of syrup. Although a latte does not, by default, come with syrup, and syrup often costs extra, you will find that many people still sweeten them. The correct or default amount of syrup for the sizes are as follows: two pumps in a tall, four pumps in a grande, and five pumps in a venti. If the venti is iced, an additional pump should be added for a total of six, as the iced venti cups are a little bit bigger than the hot cups.\\nThen, it is time to draw the espresso shots from the espresso machine. Thankfully this is a simple task. Drawing the espresso out of the machine is done simply with the click of a button. Now, Talls get one shot, while grandes and ventis get two shots. Lastly, iced ventis, similar to when they get syrup, get an extra shot of espresso, which means you put three shots into them. It is crucial not to let the espresso sit without introducing the milk for any more than ten seconds, as prolonged exposure to the air will sour it and give it a distinctly unpleasant taste. If you do let this happen, do not be surprised if you have to remake this drink for the costumer. Pour the steamed milk into it slowly, encouraging the non-foamy milk to enter it first, so that the foam can come and rest on top. Some people encourage less-practiced employees to use a spoon in order to hold back the foam initially, then release it at the end. You can utilize this method until you are comfortable enough to attempt it without the spoon. If you steam the milk just right, you will be able to make latte art in it by pouring it in a distinct way. Of course, this particular part is more of a fun fact and not required for you to do. That is how to make a latte.\\nNow there are two other drinks made at Starbucks as well, which a macchiato and a cappuccino. These are kind of alterations of the latte. For example, a macchiato is prepared by pouring the shots on top at the end, after the milk and syrup are in the cup. Whereas, A cappuccino is made by making the milk more steamy by keeping the rod near the top for longer, which means it will contain more foam. Although the each contains similar ingredients, how those ingredients are inserted into the drink will determine what you are making. Remember not confuse any of the drinks and do not fully insert the rod into cold and all of you should do well at Starbucks.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1033,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Rewrite to remove duplicated information,\",\n          \"Change wording to a more professional style.\",\n          \"Shorten and remove irrelevant sections.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"task\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"others\",\n          \"formality\",\n          \"paraphrase\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast.

The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\\n\\n        Rewritten text: ', \"Instruction: Rewrite the given text while keeping the same meaning.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\\n\\n        1.

Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\\n\\n        Example: If there were any suggestions of Mendelssohn in Dohnányi’s quartet, they reverberated into the second half of the program with the performance of that earlier composer’s final string quartet, Opus 80 in F minor.

Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The example is that the composition to be discussed was not the only piece on the program, but the second half of the program was dedicated to it. The composers are expected to be known by the composer, but this is not the case. This means that the examples must be rewritten in order to be convincing.\\n', \" Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

Seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather, but the smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose.

The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\\n', \" Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.', \"1.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80.

The band’s sound integrated rock and roll with elements of blues, psychedelia, and folk music. The band\\'s first single \"Light My Fire\" became a top 10 hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, followed by the Top 40 hit \"People Are Strange\". Following the release of the eponymous debut album in 1967, Morrison became one of the most controversial and charismatic lead singers in rock music. In 1968, the band released their second album Waiting for the Sun, which reached the top 10 and included the Top 10 single \"Hello, I Love You\". Their third album, The Soft Parade, released in 1969, reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and included the band’s first single to top the Billboard Hot 100, \"Touch Me\". Morrison’s increasing drug use and legal problems ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the band in 1971. Their 1970 live album Absolutely Live became a commercial success. The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. After Morrison’s death in 1971, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore continued to perform under the band’s name. They re-released Morrison’s recorded material and released three studio albums of new material before disbanding in 1991. In the 21st century, the band’s music has continued to garner critical acclaim and continue to influence later artists. They are often cited as one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century and their work was described by Morrison as “a book”. [source: Wikipedia]\\n'], 'trimmed_output': [' A.

Their third album, The Soft Parade, released in 1969, reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and included the band’s first single to top the Billboard Hot 100, \"Touch Me\". Morrison’s increasing drug use and legal problems ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the band in 1971. Their 1970 live album Absolutely Live became a commercial success. The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. After Morrison’s death in 1971, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore continued to perform under the band’s name. They re-released Morrison’s recorded material and released three studio albums of new material before disbanding in 1991. In the 21st century, the band’s music has continued to garner critical acclaim and continue to influence later artists. They are often cited as one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century and their work was described by Morrison as “a book”.

I didn’t want to wait any longer. It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. I waited longer than I wanted. I had to wait for the light. I didn’t want to wait. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\\n', \" Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable.

Specific for this culture are the vases with a refined painting, having three different phases – Precucuteni (carved geometrical models), Cucuteni A (spiral painted models), Cucuteni B (integrating of anthropo /zoo-morphic models, with a cosmologic role, along with geometrical models).  The civilisation is covered in a true mystery because the Cucuteni people used to set on fire their houses regularly, a ritual with many possible explanations.', ' With all consumer goods manufactured in abundance and excellent quality, it would be like putting a price on air.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy.  Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80.  Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it.  The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\\n', '', ' The process for developing your resume and using online might take a couple hours.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Deep Tissue Massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment, repetitive motions, and past lingering injuries. Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable. Keep in mind that soreness is common after the treatment, and that plenty of water should be ingested to aid with the flushing and removal of toxins that will have been released from the deep tissue during the session.\\n\\n        Rewritten text:  A deep tissue massage is a bodywork technique that targets the deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue. The goal of a deep tissue massage is to release chronic muscle tension and pain, improve circulation and joint mobility, and promote overall well-being. During a deep tissue massage, the massage therapist uses slow, firm strokes to work through the muscles and fascia. This may result in a slightly sore feeling afterwards, but this is a normal part of the process and a sign that the massage was effective. Deep tissue massage is especially beneficial for individuals with chronic muscle tension, repetitive motion injuries, and postural imbalances. It can also help alleviate symptoms of common conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). Deep tissue massage can be tailored to meet the unique needs of each client, making it a versatile and effective treatment option for many individuals. However, it is important to communicate with the massage therapist and discuss any concerns or limitations prior to the session to ensure the most effective and safe experience. Deep tissue massage can be a powerful tool for improving overall health and wellness, but it is important to approach it with open communication and a willingness to listen to your body.\\n\", 'Instruction: Rewrite the given text while keeping the same meaning.

This method of treatment has gained popularity in recent years, due in part to its effectiveness in helping to reduce chronic pain, as well as the improvement of flexibility and mobility. It is a highly effective method of treating chronic stress and injury-related issues, as it is able to target the deeper layers of tissue, where the most chronic pain and issues can be found. During the treatment, the practitioner will work to open up areas of the body that may be congested, while using deep pressure techniques to relieve tension and promote relaxation. Additionally, they will use other techniques, such as active release techniques and deep compression, to release tension from the muscle and fascia layers of the body. While the focus of the deep tissue work is on the removal of toxins and inflammation, it can also have the effect of improving flexibility, range of motion, and overall strength and mobility in the area being treated. This method of massage has also been shown to have a number of benefits, such as reducing stress and helping to promote mental health. It is a safe and effective form of treatment that is widely recognized as being beneficial to those with a number of chronic issues.\"', 'Instruction: Rewrite the given text while keeping the same meaning.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\\n', ' \"Deep tissue massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body. This method of treatment has gained popularity in recent years, due in part to its effectiveness in helping to reduce chronic pain, as well as the improvement of flexibility and mobility. It is a highly effective method of treating chronic stress and injury-related issues, as it is able to target the deeper layers of tissue, where the most chronic pain and issues can be found. During the treatment, the practitioner will work to open up areas of the body that may be congested, while using deep pressure techniques to relieve tension and promote relaxation. Additionally, they will use other techniques, such as active release techniques and deep compression, to release tension from the muscle and fascia layers of the body. While the focus of the deep tissue work is on the removal of toxins and inflammation, it can also have the effect of improving flexibility, range of motion, and overall strength and mobility in the area being treated. This method of massage has also been shown to have a number of benefits, such as reducing stress and helping to promote mental health. It is a safe and effective form of treatment that is widely recognized as being beneficial to those with a number of chronic issues.\"', ' The process for generating your resume and employing internet might take a couple of hours.

With all consumer goods manufactured in abundance and excellent quality, it would be like putting a price on air. Food, water, and shelter would be seen as human rights, and provided on request, along with a dizzying array of manufactured goods. Still, nobody would feel the need to stockpile or accumulate products, because there would be no point. Wealth would disappear as a measure of status, when everyone has the same amount of wealth. All the same, some limits would be placed at least initially, like, only twenty Laptops to a given individual.

This is a great example of a compound sentence. If you’re familiar with compound sentences, then you know that the second sentence is a dependent clause, which is then attached to the main sentence by a coordinating conjunction (and). Since the dependent clause depends on the main sentence, the second sentence is subordinate in meaning to the first sentence. It’s also worth noting that the dependent clause is not used as a subject, object, or complement to the main sentence. It’s used as a modifier, or modifier clause. The independent clause is used as a subject or object of a main verb, as well as a complement to the main verb. If the main clause is used as a subject or object, then that’s considered a passive sentence and the main verb in the main clause should be replaced with the subject or object in the independent clause. In this case, the dependent clause can be considered as the main clause, and the main clause can be considered as the independent clause.\\n\\n        This is a great example of a compound sentence because the second sentence is a dependent clause, which is then attached to the main sentence by a coordinating conjunction (and).
