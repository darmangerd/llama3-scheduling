"Caught red handed by the pedestrian’s roadblock, the blinking crosswalk light only impeded my progress. It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught. Hopefully, this morning wouldn’t be an exception.","I was impeded by the sight of a red hand of the crosswalk. It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait. It might also be because I have been late, though not due to a lack of diligence on my part, to work a couple of times already this week. Fine. 4 times. I’ve been late four times this week, and I don’t mean my typical 5 minutes late. 15-20 minutes late. The kinda late that will get the boss’s wrong attention. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. I don’t have time for either. Instead, I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee—Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. I fantasize about how delicious this commercialized brew is when I brew at home, when my thoughts are intruded by the fact no cars are on the street in front of me. Crossing my fingers that I won’t get caught, I dart across the street as my heels will take me. My progress is impeded, but not by an officer. No far worse. I did not realize until it was too late.
The whole street ahead of me was closed in preparation for an event this afternoon! I would have to take the long around this, which would take an extra 15 minutes. I ponder how this always befalls me. Dinners, family gatherings, now work—all suffer from the same curse. I am always late. And it usually involves some nonsense as this. A whole street closed?! I was dressed ant out the door before seven! Now, I am going to be late and there is a taxi to save my life right now! I rip off my heels and beginning sprinting through the closed off street. I say sorry as I scurry by and they give me a confused look more than anything. I was desperate, so I sprinted through so that I could be my usual 5 minutes late.

"If there were any suggestions of Mendelssohn in Dohnányi’s quartet, they reverberated into the second half of the program with the performance of that earlier composer’s final string quartet, Opus 80 in F minor. Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.","If there were any hints of Mendelssohn lurking in Dohnányi’s quartet, they made themselves felt throughout the second half of the program in ways that were reminiscent of that great composer’s final composition for string quartet, Opus 80 in F minor. Mendelssohn was driven by an intense inner drive, that Cellist Bonnie Hampton once described as “always burning his candle at both ends.” It isn’t hard to imagine that Mendelssohn knew how little candle he had left as he worked on Opus 80. Fortunately for us, the Takács players knew how to capture that fateful sense of urgency without overplaying their hand. The result was that an active listener could appreciate the intensity and the darkness behind the piece without being suffocated by it. In this way, listeners were also able to appreciate the solid craftsmanship at the core of all that energy.",write in style of roger ebert,others
"Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

"In this world, no money would be used either. With all consumer goods manufactured in abundance and excellent quality, it would be like putting a price on air. Food, water, and shelter would be seen as human rights, and provided on request, along with a dizzying array of manufactured goods. Still, nobody would feel the need to stockpile or accumulate products, because there would be no point. Wealth would disappear as a measure of status, when everyone has the same amount of wealth. All the same, some limits would be placed at least initially, like, only twenty Laptops to a given individual.

"We have spoken of waves ""travelling"" at such and such a rate, but they do not in reality travel at all. It is the undulation, or, so to speak, the motion of a wave, that travels; in the same manner that a wave passes from one end of a carpet to the other end when it is shaken. The water remains stationary, excepting the spray and foam on the surface, and is only possessed of a rising and sinking motion. This undulatory motion, or impulse, is transmitted from each particle of water to its neighbouring particle, until it reaches the last drop of water on the shore. But when a wave reaches shallow water it has no longer room to sink to its proper depth; hence the water composing it acquires actual motion, and rushes to the land with more or less of the tremendous violence that has been already described.","We have had discussions regarding waves ""traveling"" at a various amount of rates, although, these waves are not traveling in the slightest. Rather, it is the undulation, or, in layman terms, the sway of a current, that is actually traveling; in the same way that when you toss up a carpet, a wave starts from one end of it and goes all the way to the other. The water stays exactly where it was before (with exception to the debris and foam floating on the surface), and only moves in a rising and sinking manner. This undulatory motion, or what we could call an impulse, is transmitted from each particle of water to the neighboring one, until the last drop of water inevitably reaches the shoreline.

We also try to work on the ways we ourselves perpetuate harm as a result of our own unhealed traumas. We are working to heal our own selves as much as anyone we perceive as our enemies. We are working to change how we relate to each other in our own communities as much as we are working to change any policy.","Thesis: Popular social movements undertaken to help individuals should take great care not to re-traumatize the very people they are attempting to support. This is why we must continue to constantly improve the ways we relate to ourselves, our communities, and even those we perceive as enemies.

I have spoken with far too many people who have felt re-traumatized by the violence they saw within movements that were nominally working for their benefits. When we say that we are committed to nonviolence, that principle cannot be applied in a piecemeal fashion, where we state only that we wish to end “this kind of violence,” or “the violence that’s happening over here”. We must constantly strive to embody the principles we proclaim, and thus remain aware of the ways in which we may be perpetuating harm as a result of our own traumas. We have to work to heal ourselves just as hard as we do to heal others, and equally as hard  for those we perceive as enemies. We must be prepared to carry out a constant work of improving our relations within our own community alongside our work in our communities.",add a thesis statement,others

"Some may wish to claim, along these lines, that because they achieve the spirit of human rights, Rawls would include the alternative peoples in the Society of Peoples. But there are problems with this thought. First, Rawls makes a practical argument, claiming that including decent peoples will push them towards liberalism. “[L]iberal people should have confidence in their convictions and suppose that a decent society, when offered due respect by liberal peoples, may be more likely, over time, to recognize the advantages of liberal institutions and take steps toward becoming more liberal on its own” (62). Though this thought may be acceptable for decent societies who actively discriminate, it shows an unjustified lack of respect to alternative societies who meet all standards of justice (as measured by the spirit of human rights). These other conceptions have destroyed the sliding scale of justice that Rawls used to measure decent peoples by liberal ones such that trying to push them toward liberalism shows an implicit denial of the worth of their conceptions and societies.","Some claim that because they achieve the temperament of human liberties, Rawls would include these alternative peoples in the Society of Peoples.

This discussion falls outside the framework of our article, but nevertheless we shall cite one example. Suppose, there is some aim. Let probabilities of its attainment before and after receiving information be equal to P0 and P1 , respectively. Then the cost of information is equal to C = log2 (P1 /P0 ) (Kharkevich, 1963).

"Unfortunately, doctors sometimes fail to properly investigate a patient’s symptoms. This can occur for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, doctors make an incorrect assumption and then fail to properly test that assumption. This can occur when a patient’s symptoms seem to closely fit a commonly seen condition and that doctor simply accepts that diagnosis without further inquiry. Other misdiagnoses cases happen when a doctor neglects to order proper tests or fails to properly interpret the results of those tests. Another common cause of misdiagnosis occurs when a doctor fails to refer the patient to an appropriate specialist. Instead, the doctor feels they can treat the patient on their own without the requisite knowledge and/or experience to understand the patient’s clinical picture. Finally, another common misdiagnosis scenario is where the doctor fails to conduct a proper history from the patient (ie., ask the right questions) or fails to properly listen to the patient. As result, the doctor does not obtain important information and the diagnosis is missed.","Sadly, doctors occasionally fail to investigate a patient’s symptoms properly. It’s not usually one specific reason but a variety of reasons. One possibility is that doctors make an incorrect assumption and fail to test that assumption adequately. This can occur when a patient’s symptoms closely match another condition, and that doctor accepts that differential diagnosis without further examination. Misdiagnosed cases can also happen when a doctor overlooks ordering tests, orders the wrong tests, or misinterprets the results. Another common cause of misdiagnosis occurs when a physician fails to refer the patient to a specialist. Instead, the doctor deems they can treat the patient independently without the appropriate knowledge and expertise to understand the patient’s entire clinical picture. Lastly, another common misdiagnosis scenario is when the doctor fails to conduct a complete patient history (i.e., ask the right questions) or listen to the patient entirely. Consequently, the doctor does not acquire valid information, and the diagnosis is overlooked. To conclude, these misdiagnoses can be avoided if doctors take proper care to be vigilant and do sufficient investigation, including but not limited to testing, collecting a complete history, and knowing the limit of scope.",add a conclusion,others

"The misconstrual of Corbyn as a traditional Labour figure is actually a product of “New” Labour’s trashing of both the party’s labourist and socialist history. The Blairite discourse of modernization lumped together the corporatist Keynesianism of the party’s old right with the New Left radicalism of its enemies into a single compound, “Old” Labour. This could be made usefully responsible forthe inflation and trade-union militancy associated with the 1970s Labour governments, as well as the notorious left-right splits of the 1980s. New Labour’s erasure of these older divisions, alongside the accumulated mistakes of his rivals, enabled Corbyn tactically to don the mantle of the very social democracy he once decried as insufficient and emerge as the custodian of the party’s traditional identity.","“New” Labour wanted to fool us into thinking of Corbyn as a traditional Labour figure as part of their plan to do away with the party’s traditional labourist and socialist values.

"To help reach that goal, the company initiated an upgrade of its bioscience facility that included boiler optimization and installation of steam economizers. The economizers feature an advanced heat-recovery system developed by Gas Technology Institute (GTI) that uses Transport Membrane Condenser (TMC) technology. The technology recovers both sensible and latent heat, as well as water from the exhaust stream, to co-generate additional steam for the manufacturing process. TMC technology increases fuel-to-steam energy efficiency by up to 15 percent (for up to 95-percent fuel-to-steam efficiency). Also, it increases the capture of water from flue gases by up to 20 percent.

"Hi Laura - there are over 30 different alleles for MC1R, and it is likely that any over the counter genetic testing product only tests for the most common variants. The most likely explanation is that you do have a variant in the MC1R gene that wasn't detected by the test, as most OTC evaluations are produced to find the most common alleles. Another explanation would be that you carry another gene (other than MC1R) that is affecting hair color, though nearly all people with red hair carry a mutation in the MC1R gene. Other genes are suspected of playing a role in hair and skin pigmentation, however, so genetics is a bit more complicated than a Punnett square might suggest.","Hi Laura!

They’re a nice reminder that even simple dishes should make us take a minute out of our busy day to “stop and smell the roses”.

Advieh is the jack-of-all-trade Persian blend of spices that is added to a plethora of dishes in order to heighten flavors without much more thought. Think of Advieh as a swiss army knife. You could rub it directly on meats such as lamb and chicken, or you could add it to soups, stews, casseroles, or fish dishes. Certain Advieh dishes are different depending on what region you are in, or even what family is serving it. But one consistency, and what makes it so special, is the tantalizing hint of dried, ground rose petals. They provide a pleasant lesson worth learning as well; that even the most rudimentary dishes have the ability to make us pause from our hectic schedules and stop and smell the roses.

"It was the Thursday before the music event and Pastor Dave was giving Nathaniel Partee, 47, a ride to a scheduled appointment at a detox center, a place that would help Nathaniel stay off of his addiction. A short distance on route, he stopped at a Burger King to get something to eat for the both of them. He went through the drive-through. While waiting for their fish sandwiches in a parking space close to the building, Pastor Dave saw two teen boys skating in the parking lot. Thinking about the event that was just a little over a day away, Pastor Dave called out the window, ""Hey kids, come here."" He wanted to tell them about Jesus and invite them to the event.","It was Thursday. You could see the heat crinkle the air like it was tissue paper off the top of the SUV in front of Pastor Dave. It looked like air hell attempting to manifest on top of it. Pastor Dave had just ordered two fish sandwiches from Burger King, an odd choice he thought, since his passenger, 47 year old Nathaniel Partee, was about to go to rehab. The stomach is mighty sensitive when withdrawal is about to happen. Pastor Dave reflected on the fact that Nathaniel’s last name was a phonetic spelling of party, which, if one believed in such things, could have foretold his future. When it was their turn to reach the drive-thru window, the girl, mid-twenty something that knew the dream was as big a lie as the claim of fresh food in Burger King ad, told Pastor Dave that the fish is taking longer cause they had to find some damn fish to cook. For now, she almost tossed two drinks at Pastor Dave and told him to park and wait for them to bring the rest. 
Pastor Dave pulls into a spot. Nathaniel lights his cigarette, hand shaking a little. Slight tremors, as if his hand decided it wanted to mimic a butterfly wing. Pastor Dave remembers doing that as a kid. Made his dad worry. Wasn’t masculine behavior. Of course, all of this was a distraction of Pastor Dave. The music event was coming up and he promised a big turn out. So far, you could say there was going to be plenty of elbow room. No concern about a mosh pit. He glances at his side mirror to see if their order is approaching and he sees two kids skateboarding. Why not, he thinks. As they start to skate by, Pastor Dave yells out the window if they would be interested in a music event. The two boys stop and look at each other. The one in a blue tee shrugs at the one in a tank top. They turn around and skate toward Pastor Dave. When they stop and hold hands, Pastor Dave is faced with a conundrum. Should tell them the truth at say it is a christian music festival or simply allow them to fantasize what it could be? After all, they might think they are going into a hostile environment. But they aren’t right? Not at Pastor Dave’s church. He is open about equality, though some emails he gets aren’t happy with the direction. Thoughts of his brother flutter in as the kid in the tank top is attempting to break through the revery.

"Harburg, who worked with U.S. ag-tech startup Soft Robotics before moving to venture capital, suggested that agriculture need look no further than Amazon for a model of how to use robots for base and peak labor while retaining the best and most experienced labor. Yet the transition to robotics is nearly certain to be more difficult for agriculture than it was for Amazon. “If we automate that and robotize that, and [permanent] labor doesn’t go away,” the farmer doesn’t immediately achieve cost savings that may be necessary to implement robotics. “To me, that’s a real challenge for agricultural robots,” he said.","Harburg, who worked with the US ag-tech startup Soft Robotics before moving to venture capitalism, suggested that the agricultural industry could simply follow Amazon’s example for a blueprint on how to introduce robotic labor into their business model.

The future of robotics in agriculture may not be quite as simple as that, however, since automating only a few farming tasks while retaining human staff for the rest will be unlikely to actually cut costs enough for farmers to justify the initial investments into robotic laborers.

"In this paper, we study the problem of automatically synthesizing a successful Behavior Tree (BT) in an a-priori unknown dynamic environment. Starting with a given set of behaviors, a reward function, and sensing in terms of a set of binary conditions, the proposed algorithm incrementally learns a switching structure in terms of a BT, that is able to handle the situations encountered. Exploiting the fact that BTs generalize And-Or-Trees and also provide very natural chromosome mappings for genetic pro- gramming, we combine the long term performance of Genetic Programming with a greedy element and use the And-Or analogy to limit the size of the resulting structure. Finally, earlier results on BTs enable us to provide certain safety guarantees for the resulting system. Using the testing environment Mario AI we compare our approach to alternative methods for learning BTs and Finite State Machines. The evaluation shows that the proposed approach generated solutions with better performance, and often fewer nodes than the other two methods.","Within this text, we will analyze the issue of automatically synthesizing a prosperous Behavior Tree (BT) within an a-priori undisclosed dynamic setting.

During the evening it was found by those who engaged him in conversation that Dave was a masterful storyteller, and he spent quite some time entertaining them with hillarious yarns about life on the ocean blue. Bron suspected that several of the events that he described were perhaps tinged with more than just a bit of the blarney, however his way of describing them often had his audience roaring with laughter, and it was all good fun anyway.","Officially, the barkeep had closed up for the evening, and old Dave had been relieved of his posting.

"There are artists that are able to step away from the spotlight for a while, but are never truly gone. Houston-based visionary Nosaprise is definitely one of those artists. As his musical career was beginning to take off, Nosaprise suddenly found inspiration in several other aspects of his life that required immediate attention. After yoga afforded him an opportunity to travel the world, and after successfully beginning a family, Nosaprise was able to bring all of that worldly knowledge gained back to his musical craft. His music was always compelling, but now there is a growth and a depth to it that only awareness of the larger world and larger consciousness can bring… with his latest single Vamanos he is bravely experimental, bold in his statements, and thought-provoking in his delivery. Hopefully this is just a taste of what lies ahead for Nosaprise, as his return is very welcome.","Some artists are capable of stepping out of the limelight for periods of time without ever being completely gone from it.  Houston-based visionary Nosaprise definitely falls into this category. Just as his musical career was beginning to take form, he felt compelled to explore other avenues of his creativity.

Eventually he was able to bring the lessons learned from all these experiences back into his musical craft. His art had always been compelling, but after his hiatus his work returned with an extra layer of depth and wisdom present that hadn’t been there before. His latest single, Vamanos, is extremely experimental, yet remains as timeless and thought-provoking as any of his previous hits. With these factors in mind, we feel that Vamanos should be awarded 4.8 stars out of 5, and sincerely hope that we’ll hear more out of Nosaprise soon.",add a rating,others

"But lithium ion batteries, to be quite honest, are probably going to be good for 4 to 6 hours of grid storage and up to a couple hundred megawatts in scale. When you get beyond that, the challenges of lithium ion scalability become apparent. If you think about this, with lithium ion batteries, we have battery cells arranged into battery packs that are simply multiplied in number to achieve more storage capacity. So it’s almost like a linear progression in cost, because you’re not generating any more electricity from batteries. Rather, you’re just storing it for later use. When you want to shift the use of electricity in time, you’re adding cost to achieve the flexibility. So at some point it really doesn’t make a lot of sense to go with lithium ion if you’re talking about long-term storage that needs to have some very significant economies of scale to be economical.","Lithium ion batteries are probably only capable of handling 4 to 6 hours of grid storage and up to a couple hundred megawatts at a time, anything beyond that and you begin to run into scaling issues. Currently, lithium ion batteries work by being arranged into battery packs, with more packs simply added whenever more capacity is needed. This means that the costs of lithium ion battery systems scale proportionally to their size, with additional costs coming into play to fill all that battery space and to quickly use it when you need it. At a certain point in scale, using lithium ion batteries simply stops being an effective strategy.",make it more accessible to a general audience,others

"According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small busi­ ness lending actually fell 6. 2 percent to $652.2 billion in 2010 from a year earlier. Also, a Federal Reserve report indicates that commer­ cial real estate loans have fallen from $1.73 trillion to $1.46 trillion since December 2008. So why is there such a disparity between bank and federal government loan data? This is primarily due to the different ways banks and government agencies calculate lending sta­ tistics. When financial institutions report a rise in their lending activi­ ties, they often refer to new or renewed loans in a particular period of time — usually the most recent quarter. Conversely, most government lending data includes the total outstanding credit or what is owed to a bank, regardless of whether it is a new or existing loan. This balance drops as loans are repaid, but will rise as new loans are made.","Bank and Federal Government Load Statistics: Stats and Logistics

The U.S. Small Business Administration has declared that small business lending, in reality, dropped 6.2%, specifically to the amount of $652.2 billion in 2010 from one year previously. Additionally, a Federal Reserve declaration shows that commercial real estate loans have fallen from $1.73 trillion to $1.46 trillion since December of 2008. So what is the reason for such an inconsistency between bank and federal government loan statistics? This is mostly because of the differences between the ways banks and government agencies find their data in regards to lending. In the instances of financial institutions reporting a hike up in their lending habits, a lot of the time, they are referring to new or renewed loans within a certain time period (usually the most recent quarter). At the same time, a lot of government loan stats include all the outstanding credit, or what is owed to a bank, without any regard of whether or not the loan is new or existing. This amount lowers when loans are repaid, but will hike up when new loans are made.

"Optimization-based segmentation approaches deriving from discrete graph-cuts and continuous max-flow have become increasingly nuanced, allowing for topological and geometric constraints on the resulting segmentation while retaining global optimality. However, these two considerations, topological and geometric, have yet to be combined in a unified manner. This paper presents the concept of shape complexes, which combine geodesic star convexity with extendable continuous max-flow solvers. These shape complexes allow more complicated shapes to be created through the use of multiple labels and super-labels, with geodesic star convexity governed by a topological ordering. These problems can be optimized using extendable continuous max-flow solvers. Previous work required computationally expensive co-ordinate system warping which are ill-defined and ambiguous in the general case. These shape complexes are validated in a set of synthetic images as well as atrial wall segmentation from contrast-enhanced CT. Shape complexes represent a new, extendable tool alongside other continuous max-flow methods that may be suitable for a wide range of medical image segmentation problems.","Optimization-based segmentation of medical images has become an increasingly complicated and tricky task to accomplish recently, allowing topological and geometric factors to be considered while maintaining the overall cohesiveness of the images.

This content is all too often published and republished without any credit being given to the original creators. Google now has several tools that can be used to catch plagiarism, however, so it has become increasingly important to make all writing and content in a unique manner.

"This first effort at historical performance in the classroom was an enlightening experiment. It excited students so much that I soon discovered, somewhat to my chagrin, that they remembered details about the fall of Constantinople long after they had forgotten related issues that I deemed to be more important. It seemed that a bit of storytelling to a passive audience could elicit extraordinarily vivid recall, and more important, an added appreciation for the immediacy of the past. Thus, while the technique was not yet especially conducive to promoting historical thinking, it seemed to hold potential. Adopting the character of Brother John Paleologus, the name I gave to my siege participant, was really only a more dramatic and theatrical approach to a traditional lecture method, but it was a successful one. I deduced that greater student involvement and interaction with a historical character might enhance the quality of learning.","This first attempt at a classroom based historical performance was very enlightening. This lesson style excited students to such a degree that I found they were capable of recalling far more about the fall of Constantinople than about other, related topics I considered far more important. Apparently, persuasive storytelling directed towards a passive audience can have extraordinary effects on memory and empathy towards the past. While this technique of character-based historical storytelling resembles many elements of the theater more closely than a traditional lecture, I feel that relating historical events through the eyes of a fictional participant enhances student interaction with and understanding of the material.",make this more concise,others
"You begin in the fictional country of Palinero, a tropical and war-torn region with a Spanish feel. The landscape is mostly dense jungle with a few outposts connected by primitive roads.

What makes this even more inexcusable is that the graphics are only marginally better than the Jagged games of the late 90\'s.

"In any case, the question of absolute “proof” is of no interest to me. We are in no position to wait for absolute anything. We need help now. And incontrovertibly, there is evidence — not proof, but real evidence, published in a score of leading academic journals — that animal fat makes MS patients worse. It is very clearly something to avoid. In my view, which is the view of a highly motivated layperson whose livelihood is, coincidentally, based in doing careful research, there is not the remotest question that impaired lipid metabolism plays a significant role in the progression of MS. Nobody understands exactly how it works, just yet, but if I were a neurologist myself, I would certainly be telling my patients, listen, you! — just in case, now. Please stick to a vegan plus fish diet, given that the cost-benefit ratio is so incredibly lopsided in your favor. There’s no risk to you. The potential benefit is that you stay well.","Regardless, I'm not intrigued by an inquiry of absolute ""proof."" We are not in a place where we can wait for any kind of absolute. We require immediate help. Irrefutably, there is evidence. Not simply proof but legitimate evidence published in numerous premier academic journals. These journals insist that animal fat is harmful to MS patients. The Multiple Sclerosis Trust published, ""High levels of saturated fats are associated with risk of MS, and also obesity and cardiovascular issues. Obesity is linked to higher levels of inflammation and immune stimulation, and may make MS symptoms worse."" It is obviously something that should be avoided. In my opinion, which is the perspective of a layman with devout motivation whose livelihood is, as a coincidence, centered on doing meticulous research, there is not the slightest question that impaired lipid metabolism heavily contributes to the progression of MS. Nobody is sure how it works, as of yet. Still, if I were a neurologist, I would inform patients. Just to play it safe, maintain a vegan diet, but you can also eat fish, given that the pro-con ratio is heavily in your favor. You have no risk. The benefit is that you remain healthy. Conor Kerley PHD states, ""There are multiple mechanisms by which a whole foods, plant-based diet could be beneficial for preventing and treating MS including changing the gut microbiome and the immune system, decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation and increasing blood flow around the body, including to the brain.""",add references,others

"Lugosi became a national celebrity when he reprised his stage success for the Universal Pictures film adaptation of Dracula (1931). The success of Universal’s Frankenstein in the same year established the studio as the top producer of horror films and established Lugosi and Boris Karloff (who starred in the role of Frankenstein’s Monster, a role Lugosi had turned down) as masters of the genre. Lugosi’s subsequent movies included an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe’s Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), White Zombie (1932), Island of Lost Souls (1933), and Mark of the Vampire (1935). He costarred with Karloff in several films, including The Black Cat (1934), The Raven (1935), and The Invisible Ray (1936), and he appeared occasionally in non-horror films, such as the Paramount Pictures all-star comedy International House (1933) and director Ernst Lubitsch’s comedy Ninotchka (1939).","Lugosi became a national star when he revisited the character Dracula for the Universal Pictures film adaptation of the play in 1931.

"My research on offshore oil evolved into a long-range effort to preserve, document, and analyze the history of the offshore industry in the Gulf Coast region. I have served as chief historian on three interdisciplinary and collaborative research projects sponsored by the Department of Interior’s Minerals Management Service (since 2011, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM).

Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high as you begin readying your vegetables. Toss your vegetables with olive oil until they are lightly coated (if using mushrooms, top with balsamic if desired). As you are grilling your vegetables (either directly on the grill or in a grilling basket if the grates are not narrow enough), sprinkle them with salt and pepper, and grill until they just become softened and charred on either side, then remove from the grill. 

When you are done with that, split your pizza dough into four equally sized pieces, place it on the grill, and cook it for 2-3 minutes on each side. Make sure to pop any dough bubbles as they start to form to ensure your dough is as smooth as possible so it holds the toppings. After removing it from the grill, spread ¼ cup of BBQ sauce onto each piece, then top with your choice of veggies and cheese. Return the pizzas to the grill for 3-4 minutes with the lid of the grill shut in order to melt the cheese and warm the toppings. Once the dough has risen, and the cheese is bubbling to your liking, remove from the grill, and serve with crushed red pepper on the side.

"The affect on spin of altering the coefficient of friction between a string and a ball is examined. The coefficient of friction was increased by filing the string surface. Only the string surfaces that would contact the ball were filed. In this way, the friction between strings was not altered so that the mains could continue to slide unimpeded on the cross strings. A plexiglass frame was constructed to view the impact from the side and to measure all the ball and string parameters during contact. Stringbeds were constructed with and without cross strings in order to determine the nature of the string-to-ball interaction. In this manner, the forces and mechanisms involved in spin generation could be isolated and measured.","The effect of altering the coefficient of friction between a string and a ball is what will be examined today.

However, both environmental and social problems with this technology have been foreseen. Suicide waves of Indian farmers prove the vast problems in Indian agriculture, especially in the rural areas of the country. The question that interests me in this field is, in how far opposition networks lobbying against agricultural biotechnology can be organized via modern information and communication technologies (ICT). I.e. do the ICT help to establish strong, well organized networks that can be truly influential?

"Eurasian Water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) is regarded by conservation practitioners as one of the most challenging invasive aquatic plants to manage. Owing to its broad tolerance to environmental conditions, vegetative propagation, and rapid establishment and growth, M. spicatum introductions have the potential to drastically alter macrophyte species assemblages via a loss of native species and their respective ecosystem functions. Following the discovery of a single specimen of M. spicatum in the Saint John River, near Fredericton, New Brunswick (Canada) we further investigated the localized distribution of this nonindigenous species. Thirteen areas were identified as potential M. spicatum habitat and were surveyed by wading or snorkeling. Specimens of M. spicatum were collected and morphological identifications were verified through genetic analyses (ITS2; rbcLa). The results of our investigation confirm the presence of M. spicatum at six different locations within the Saint John River. Here we discuss the implications of this discovery in the context of the contiguous aquatic habitats along a large river system.","Eurasian Water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) is considered by conservationists to be one of the most difficult invasive species to manage.

Firstly, we can say that design develops students’ abilities in tackling a particular kind of problem. This kind of problem is characterised as ill-defined, or ill-structured, and is quite distinct from the kinds of well-structured problems that lie in the educational domains of the sciences and the humanities.

He just wanted to be on a stage more and more after that. After he gets out of college, Jed formed a band called GuRGLe that played for a couple years in and around the New York area. They also did a couple of short road trips along the East coast.

You feel empowered and strong; that's your mind doing its job, but a comforting belief is not necessarily true; that's why I abandoned religion.

When things are going well in life, you don’t need such defenses nearly as much, but when things get hard, then the mind has to be able to comfort itself with thoughts such as personal superiority over others. At the end of the day, I think it is just a comforting belief the mind clings to in times of need, I eventually abandoned religion for similar reasons.

"Dawn stem water potentials of Quercus agrifolia, Juglans california, and Heteromeles arbutifolia were measured with a pressure chamber during the drought of 1972. Individuals of a particular species growing at the top of a slope had lower water potentials than those at the canyon bottom. These differences became greater as the season progressed and soil drying occurred. During the summer months when evaporative demands were high, leaf water deficits were not overcome during the overnight equilibration period as soil-plant water potential gradients existed in the dawn hours. Juglans and Heteromeles on the south-facing slope were able to maintain higher diurnal stem water potential maxima than corresponding individuals on the north-facing slope. This apparent anomaly may result from the more xeric conditions on the south-facing slope inducing acclimation or providing selection pressure for drought resistance of these two species.","The research examined how drought affected the water potentials of Quercus agrifolia, Juglans california, and Heteromeles arbutifolia. Quercus agrifolia, also known as the coast live oak, is a large, evergreen tree that is found throughout California. It is drought-resistant, but long drought conditions can cause its water potential to fall. Juglans california, popularly known as the California black walnut, is a deciduous tree, and Heteromeles arbutifolia, also known as the toyon or Christmas berry, is a small, evergreen tree or shrub.
These trees are usually found in Mediterranean climates and are adapted to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The research found that individuals of a certain species growing at the top of a slope had lower water potentials than those at the canyon base. As the season progressed and the soil dried, these distinctions became more pronounced. Because soil-plant water potential gradients existed in the early morning hours during the summer months when evaporative demands were higher, leaf water deficiencies were not overcome during the overnight equilibration period as soil-plant water potential gradients existed in the early morning hours.
Juglans and Heteromeles on the south-facing incline were able to hold more diurnal stem water potential maxima than similar individuals on the north-facing incline. This obvious oddity could be attributed to very dry conditions on the south-facing incline causing acclimation or providing selection pressure for drought resistance capacities in these two species.",add more details,others

"The exponential increase in fiber optic networks’ capacity claimed by new applications such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and streaming services calls for novel scientific approaches and low cost technological innovations to fulfill market demands. In this sense, all-optical networks are a promising solution, avoiding the electronic bottlenecks of several optical-electrical-optical (O/E/O) conversions, as well as its inherent latency . In Data Centers (DCs) optical packet switching (OPS) achieves latencies up to 25 ns, representing a clear improvement in comparison with the 90 ns typically introduced by equivalent all-electrical switches . Complementarily, all-optical interconnects provide power consumption reduction , , cooling systems simplification and effortless network expansion.","The exponential hike in fiber optic networks’ holding amount presented by new applications like the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and streaming services suggests a use for new scientific methods and cheap technological examples of progression in order to satisfy market needs.

The research was prompted by one of the researcher’s father, who after eating a quarter-pound of celery every day for one week observed his blood pressure dropped from 158 over 96 to a normal reading of 118 over 82.

The first shot creates the durable inner housing to which all the parts are attached and case fixings located. The second shot adds an external flexible skin that will prevent any friction (sparks) and cushion the housing in the event of a drop onto concrete at minus 5 degrees.

There is a little too much summation of what has already gone before, but there is also a seeming unwillingness to credit the ideas that made it all possible. The scholars who offer opinions are correct to stress the idea that for most of those who participated as well as the country that went through it, the Rising had its foundations in a long-simmering, historically-complex, and popular resentment at British colonial power. Despite being part of a union, Ireland was never treated as such nor did the vast majority of the Irish people think of themselves as equal in any sense.","Towards the end of 1916, the Irish Rebellion engages with the legacy of the Rising.

"PAC1 is coupled to AC and PLC, which induce production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and increase intracellular Ca2+ subsequent to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) [7,8]. In our present studies, PLC inhibitor U73122 and AC inhibitor ddA completely inhibited PACAP-induced neurite outgrowth (Figure 4A). This indicates cross talk between the AC/PKA and PLC/PKC pathways during PACAP-induced neurite outgrowth. Note also that with 10−5 M U73122, neurite outgrowth was inhibited more than in the vehicle group (Figure 4A), suggesting that normal physiologic neurite outgrowth may be regulated via the PLC pathway.

"It is usually acknowledged that strategic planning is working on visions and on the involvement of stakeholder in a reflection about the future with the aim to produce a change in the immediate action and in partial choices (Albrechts and Van Den Broeck 2004). It is also recognised that strategy making is the process that helps specific episodes of innovation to be transformed into institutionalised practices which, if are successful and “travel”, could on the end transform the governance culture (Healey 2007). There is a parallelism here with the recall that Peter Galison does of anthropological linguists who show that “pidgin English” is a simplified form of language which is essential for allowing communication and exchange between local populations in colonies and colonizers. Over time this simplified form can evolve into a creole and eventually into a full language. But without the original pidgin no language could exist.","Generally speaking, strategic planning is the process of converting individual successes in innovation into big picture, systemic changes. This is the process by which new discoveries and methods of operation become accepted, institutionalized, and eventually grow influential enough to change whole cultures. This is somewhat similar to the research Peter Galison has done into anthropological studies on the growth of dialects and languages in nations that had been under colonial rule. The studies focused specifically on the development of something called “pidgin English” in some of these areas, which was a simplified form of the language often spoken between the colonizers and the colonized. Over time, these simplified forms of English developed into local varieties of creole, eventually blossoming into their own full fledged languages. In this way, pidgin English acted as the early innovation which became institutionalized and eventually culture shaping.  ",make this more accessible to a general audience,others

It is about the size of an iPhone 6 and fits easily into your hand. It might be either a con or a pro, but this is the only task that this device preforms. Nothing else. An additional con might be that some might find its viewing lens to be too small at 25 millimeters. It has a decent price point of 199 dollars. However, I wanted to better understand how to properly use my Nexus range finder. It is then that I discovered that Precision Golf has awesome customer service and support. The reviewer’s comment that you will get a call from one of the owner’s is true. I had questions about operating my new NEXUS rangefinder and I got an email response from one of the owners who was available to assist me. His explanation and assistance in operating my NEXUS helped me understand how to properly us my NEXUS. I am looking forward to using it on the course when the weather gets warmer. Bottomline, I know I would not get this type of personal attention from Bushnell or Leopold. Thank you Precision Golf for your outstanding customer service.",add more details about the product,others
"Let’s use the metaphor of a city bike tour. The organizers have come together because they know they want to offer something. Their overall purpose is to offer an experience that allows citizens to see their city in a new way, to feel more connected to the city. They imagine that after the bike tour, the impact on citizens is inspiration to find new ways to participate in their city, to simply enjoy it and work to improve it. To pull off a good event, the organizers then need to dig deeper, more specifically, into the purposes of the bike tour, and the purposes of the events that will happen along the way. They have a few options.","Let us understand it this way: Imagine you are about to take a bike tour, but this is not a regular tour. The organizers have a higher purpose in mind; they want people to experience their city in a new way, create a sense of connection with the community, and ultimately inspire positive change. They believe that after the tour, people will get more inspired and involved in the betterment of the city. So, they might make various types of bike tours available, and you could go for the one that fits your interests and needs. It may be educational or just inspirational. After taking a tour, people like you may start volunteering at a local shelter or simply take more walks around your neighborhood, appreciating the little things. So, in order to make this kind of impact, organizers have to go deeper with their planning. They have to analyze each and every aspect of the tour—the main purpose and the events along the route.

"This week students wrapped up their projects and spent time working towards getting on track in their classes. More specifically, in English 9, students debated topics ranging from free college to affirmative action. Also in Math I, students explored linear functions by climbing the ladder through self directed tasks. I appreciated seeing all of our students take ownership of their learning as we closed out classes for the calendar year. In our All School Meeting today, we also encouraged students to continue to own their learning over break and take time to study for their Content Assessments and work on their projects so they can keep up their momentum when we return in January.","This week, students finished their projects and focused on getting on track in their classes.

"The spectrum of the two-dimensional continuum Dirac operator in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field consists of Landau levels, which are degenerate and separated by gaps. On the lattice the Landau levels are spread out by discretization artefacts, but a remnant of their structure is clearly visible (Hofstadter butterfly). If one switches on a non-Abelian interaction, the butterfly structure will be smeared out, but the lowest Landau level will still be separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum. In this talk we discuss how the eigenmodes of the four-dimensional QCD Dirac operator are built out of the two-dimensional eigenmodes of the Dirac operator diagonalized on each slice at fixed (z,t). In particular, starting from this decomposition, we consider how well certain physical quantities are approximated by using only the two-dimensional eigenmodes belonging to the lowest Landau level.","Two dimensional Dirac operators give off a spectrum consisting of Landau levels when in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field. These Landau levels are separated by gaps and are spread out on a lattice by discretion artefacts, but some of their structure can still be seen, appearing as what’s called a “Hofstadter butterfly”. The butterfly disappears when a non-Abelian interaction is initiated, but the lowest Landau level will still be separated from the rest on a spectrum. Today we will discuss how eigenmodes of the four-dimensional QCD Dirac operator can be constructed from two-dimensional eigenmodes of the Dirac operator that have been diagonalized on each slice.

"The Younger Dryas appeared similar to earlier events known as Heinrich events that were prominent in the Pleistocene (approximately 70,000 to 14,000 years ago) (1). Their cause is not altogether clear, but marine cores, primarily in the north-east Atlantic are festooned with layers of sand, pebbles and rock (lithic materials). These deposits arrived in this area by being carried within “large armadas” of ice that upon melting deposited their lodes on the ocean bottom. Rapid climate shifts have been linked to ice melt from sea ice and the large continental glaciers that surrounded the North Atlantic. Lower salinity meltwater is less dense than ocean water and tends to float as a freshwater cap over the marine waters, and this is perceived as associated with North Atlantic Ocean circulation disruption. The Younger Dryas is understood to be linked with meltwater almost solely from the great continental ice sheets.","The Younger Dryas is similar to Heinrich events that happened 70,000 to 14,000 years ago.

"3. The BNP was originally, and until recently, at heart a socialist party with an economic policy based on 1930's fascist models that have largely been forgotten outside far-right fringe movements. The party's generally working-class orientation (its voters are largely alienated white working class; its leadership is generally upper-working-class with a sprinkling of the exceptionally independent-minded highly educated) made socialism natural, as did its early recognition that mass immigration to Britain was largely driven by business interests. However, Margaret Thatcher killed the credibility of socialism in Britain, so the party has since moved towards a form of economic nationalism that combines worker-owned ESOP capitalism (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) with an admiration for the paternalistic developmental economics of East Asian nations like Japan and the Asian ""tigers.""","The BNP was initially, and until not long ago, in its soul a socialist group with a fiscal policy based on 1930's fascist ideals that have mostly been abandoned beyond certain groups of radical conservative.

"You may wonder how DNA could possibly relate to agricultural yields, but the link is actually quite an interesting one that is a curious mix of nature and technology. Agricultural yields can be increased through the use of genetic modification (GM), which relies on taking coveted properties from one organism and inserting these genes into another organism to create those same desired effects. The idea behind increasing agricultural yields is to provide more crops at reduced costs. While genetically modified crops have generally been created to feed people in developed nations, research has suggested that their use in developing countries has been far more beneficial.","Are you curious about how something like DNA could positively affect agricultural yields? It is an amazing topic, and the connection is actually an interesting mix of the natural world and advanced technology. By using genetic modification (GM), which is based on taking coveted properties from one organism and inserting these genes into another, agricultural yields could be increased manifold. Additionally, such crops could be made more resistant to pests, diseases, and environmental stressors. The ultimate goal behind using GM is to increase agricultural yields and provide more crops at lower prices. Although genetically modified crops have normally been created for developed nations, a recent study suggests that their usefulness in developing countries could be far more valuable. Since GM has the potential to boost yields and deliver more reliable food sources, such crops have the power to transform agriculture and help feed an expanding global population.

"We apply our formulated approach in Chapter 3 to a set of collinear spin problems whereby the two magnetic layers in our general multilayer junction (consisting of two ferromagnets separated by a non-magnetic spacer layer) have their rotated magnetizations either ferromagnetically or anti-ferromagnetically aligned (parallel/anti-parallel to the net magnetization). Our analytical results provide the necessary conditions for optimising tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and show how a `switching' effect can be used to control it. We achieve this by calculating analytically in the ferromagnetic configuration the necessary conditions to support a 100% transmission success rate in one spin channel whilst making it very difficult for transmission to occur in the other spin channel. However, we show conclusively that re-aligning the magnetization to the anti-ferromagnetic configuration under the same conditions will make it very difficult for transmission to occur in either spin channel.","We may be able to optimize tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by rotating a pair of ferromagnets around a non-magnetic space layer. By switching the orientation of the magnetic fields (parallel or perpendicular to the main field), we should be able to exert control over the TMR. We can run calculations to determine what the optimal patterns and timing of these magnetic switches will be in order to encourage transmission through one specific spin channel. We have also found, however, that re-aligning the magnetic fields under the same conditions will discourage transmission through any channels.",make it more accessible to a general audience,others
"An economic policy expert has warned that plans to enact the NEEEF Bill in its current format could have adverse effects on the country’s economy and subsequently place the economy on a lower growth trajectory. Former Namfisa CEO, Rainer Ritter – writing in his private capacity, said in a submission made to the Law Reform and Development Commission regarding the New Equitable Economic Empowerment Framework (NEEEF) policy that from a timing perspective, it [NEEEF] is not opportune for the Namibian economy in the next three years. “The introduction of NEEEF in its present form will achieve the opposite; it will put the Namibian economy on a lower growth trajectory, similar to the economic period 1978-89 before independence. It is recommended that the NEEEF policy is put on ice until Cabinet has more clarity on the pros and cons of the current NEEEF Bill,” Ritter said. Ritters’ remarks come as Government considers possible reforms to the black empowerment policy by introducing the contentious NEEEF policy.","The piece of text is regarding a certain law expert’s cautionary statement regarding the NEEEF Bill. The expert states that the Bill could cause antagonizing effects on the country’s financials and in turn make the economy’s rate of growth lower than before.

In fact, they provide the recommendation that the NEEEF policy be halted until the Cabinet obtains more understanding on the good and and bad of the current NEEEF Bill.

"Thanks to tons of new data about human movements, we're learning a lot about how social networks, people's movements, and dynamic processes like epidemics relate to one another. In this study we looked at how long people spent face-to-face in different environments. The two scenarios we focused on here were a science conference and a long-term museum exhibition. We kept track of how many times people interacted face-to-face, and for how long, then we studied these interactions to find the similarities and differences between them. We'll use this data to predict how epidemics might behave under different social circumstances. We found that epidemics would spread much differently between the conference and the museum scenarios. Diving deeper into the methods of disease spreading in those scenarios shows us that awareness of the many interactions between the different social networks would lead people into buying false ideas about how disease would spread across those networks.  ","The availability of new data sources on human mobility is opening new avenues for investigating the interplay of social networks, human mobility and dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading.

"Because an across-the-board rate reduction doesn’t really stimulate things too well, its cost effectiveness isn’t great either. Even though households that are in the lower tax bracket would get a benefit, most tax reductions like that would go out to taxpayers who make more money. This is because households that make more money pay an unequal share of income taxes. But as we’ve already talked about, these households are assumed not to be as responsive to more after-tax income as lower- and middle-income households. Combined with a likely big loss in money from an across-the-board rate reduction, this means that the ""bang for the buck"" would be low. The effect of the stimulus is brought even further down if sizable shortfalls lead to higher interest rates, crowding out private investment.","Because the stimuluative effect of an across-the-board rate reduction is low, so too is its cost effectiveness.

"The trials where we look at quantum phenomena in heavily linked many particle systems is hard to do because of how short they are and how little time there is to do them. Getting it at the same time rate control of individual parts seems like it’s even harder to challenge, which means it’s even harder to date inhibits using systems like quantum computing devices. We’ve made a lot of progress to overcome these problems with cold atoms in optical lattices, where a detailed control of collective properties is possible but it’s super difficult to address, so it’s harder to control or measure distinct sites. Here we’re showing, that polaritons, used with atom and photon excitations, in a bunch of cavities like a photonic crystal or coupled toroidal micro-cavities, can make a strongly interacting many body system, where distinct particles can be controlled and measured. Everything needed to build the suggested setting has already happened through tests, which shows just what this device can do as a quantum simulator. Since it’s possible to make attractive on-site potentials, the scheme allows the formation of really entangled states and a phase with particles a lot more delocalized than in superfluids.","The experimental observation of quantum phenomena in strongly correlated many particle systems is difficult because of the short length- and timescales involved.

"We're gonna talk about how evolution naturally creates a tiered class system through changes in individual nature. We'll show you how these transitions come about from the forces of natural selection acting on different levels of the biological process. The main transition happens at one specific point in the evolutionary process, and we're gonna show how that point matches up with a phase transition in how information gets passed along through the creation of self-completing info bottlenecks. We've even got an abstract model to use for describing these transitions, that is vague enough to be able to apply to many different versions of the same idea. Look at multicellularity for instance, specifically a randomly generated model of individuals in a community (cells) transition into a more teamwork based community (multicellularity). This transition point can be found by noting when the number of cells needed to make new communities drops far below the previous number needed to make new communities. In that way, the communites as a whole start reproducing more even as the individual cells involved do it less. We also showed that horizontal gene transfer greatly lowers the bar required to make this process happen. And right there we've got two of the most important parts of multicellularity: the growth of a developmental process and reproduction through a unicellular bottleneck.  ","We explain how hierarchical organization of biological systems emerges naturally during evolution, through a transition in the units of individuality. We will show how these transitions are the result of competing selective forces operating at different levels of organization, each level having different units of individuality. Such a transition represents a singular point in the evolutionary process, which we will show corresponds to a phase transition in the way information is encoded, with the formation of self - reinforcing information bottlenecks. We present an abstract model for characterizing these transitions that is quite general, applicable to many different versions of such transitions. As a concrete example, we consider the transition to multicellularity. Specifically, we study a stochastic model where isolated communities of interacting individuals ( e.g. Cells ) undergo a transition to higher - order individuality ( e.g. Multicellularity ). This transition is indicated by the marked decrease in the number of cells utilized to generate new communities from pre - existing ones. In this sense, the community begins to reproduce as a whole via a decreasing number of cells. We show that the fitness barrier to this transition is strongly reduced by horizontal gene transfer. These features capture two of the most prominent aspects of the transition to multicellularity: the evolution of a developmental process and reproduction through a unicellular bottleneck.","Too conversational, rephrase it to be more formal?",formality

"A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today. Manager's Journal: What Enron Did Right By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner  11/19/2001 The Wall Street Journal A20 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy. Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage. We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.","A beautiful article in the Wall Street Journal on this day.

Accountable for the vagaries of maturity (Jack Welch), merchandise loss (Ford/Firestone tires), corporation rival (Lucent, AT&T), machinery (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), administrators and their corporations emphasize to us that being well known publicly is a volatile matter. The freshest empirical evidence is Enron, whose decline in favor has developed in a projected fire sale to Dynegy. Once thought of as one of the nation’s most technologically advanced corporations, Enron transitioned to an outcast due to an absence of pellucidity about its deals and the odor of disputes at hand.

We have not yet been informed concerning the legitimate or behavioral problems under examination. We confer that more pellucidity about prospective disputes at hand is required.

"Hydrogen adatoms are one of the most exciting schemes for the functionalization of graphene. Hydrogen causes tapering resonances close to the dirac energy, making magnetic moments. Also, they're going to make local lattice curved that boost the spin-orbit pairing. This combo of magnetism and spin-orbit pairing gives way for a lot of different phases, and some these even have minor topological traits. We're going to look at how magnetism and spin-orbit work with each other for pairing in direct formation of hydrogen on graphene single layers, and it's grouped into the diff phases that could happen. We're going to branch our model out to think about the formations of adsorbates in graphene-like crystals with powerful inherent spin-orbit pairings.","Hydrogen adatoms are one of the most the promising proposals for the functionalization of graphene. Hydrogen induces narrow resonances near the dirac energy, which lead to the formation of magnetic moments.

We analyze the interplay between magnetism and spin - orbit coupling in ordered arrays of hydrogen on graphene monolayers, and classify the different phases that may arise.

"Estimates of speeds from time series of photospheric and/or chromospheric vector magnetograms can be used to figure out fluxes of magnetic energy (poynting flux) and helicity across the magnetogram layer, and to provide time-dependent boundary settings for data-driven simulations of solar atmosphere on top of this layer. Speed components perpendicular to this field are needed both to figure out transport rates and to determine model boundary settings. We discuss some approaches to estimating perpendicular flows from magnetograms. Since doppler shifts have input from flows parallel to the magnetic field, perpendicular speeds aren't generally recoverable from just doppler shifts. The induction equation s vertical component relates evolution in @xmath0 to the perpendicular flow field, but has a finite null space (meaning some ""null"" flows like motions along normal field shapes, don't affect @xmath0.) Because of this, added info is needed to correctly ID the perpendicular flow field. Tracking methods, which track @xmath1 in a neighborhood, have a long heritage, but other methods have recently been put to use. In a recent paper, many techniques were tested using synthetic magnetograms from mhd sims. Here, we use the same test data to ID: 1) the ability of the induction equation s normal component, by itself, to estimate flows; and 2) a tracking method s ability to recover flow components perpendicular to @xmath2 and parallel to shapes of @xmath0.

Velocity components perpendicular to the magnetic field are necessary both to compute these transport rates and to derive model boundary conditions.

Consequently, additional information is required to accurately specify the perpendicular flow field. Tracking methods, which analyze @xmath1 in a neighborhood, have a long heritage, but other approaches have recently been developed. In a recent paper, several such techniques were tested using synthetic magnetograms from mhd simulations. Here, we use the same test data to characterize: 1 ) the ability of the induction equation s normal component, by itself, to estimate flows; and 2 ) a tracking method s ability to recover flow components that are perpendicular to @xmath2 and parallel to contours of @xmath0.

Each casualty is subject to a $100 floor, meaning that only losses in excess of $100 are deductible for each casualty. Additionally, casualty losses are deductible only to the extent that aggregate losses exceed 10% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI). Only casualty losses not compensated for by insurance or otherwise can be deducted.",More formal,formality

" Europeans have split Morocco into States, or kingdoms, even though splitting areas like that doesn’t really happen in the administrations of the native prince.

Thanks Rod  Brent  Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks","Dear Rod, as previously deliberated, I am providing the bullet points that compiles what our consultants stated. Primarily, the demand is pictured to lead us to believe that it will be 2006 before California’s market will restore itself to 2000 and 2001’s levels. 2002’s demand is down at approximately 900 mmcf/d. 2003 demand will level out. Growth in demand will start to occur in 2004. Finally, 2005-2006 will be when the demand will return to 2001’s standards. This is because there was a drought during 2001, and the lack of hydro generation produced an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for fuel in California. An anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California. State of the art, more streamlined power plants with better torridity rates will expel more mature fuel fired generation. This reduces the quantity of fuel required to generate a MW of energy on the fringe of California energy rate expansions have reduced demand for power and thereupon, fuel transference volume into the state. Throughout the next two or three years, there will be a supplementary 2.0 Bcf/d of transference volume into California 800 mmcf/d in 2002 900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion) 300 mmcf/d (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up). San Juan Basin manufacturing was reduced during the first six months of 2001 versus the first six months of 2000 manufacturing, inaccurate by an estimated 200 mmcf/d. Rockies fuel will not take the place of reducing manufacturing in San Juan. San Juan fuel will approach Permian pricing. The consultants are of the opinion that the amalgamation of these aspects will persuade decontracting on current transference into the state of California, and principally the El Paso and Transwestern lines. Though, according to them, the unpredictable factor is the unsought power demand growth for California. As previously deliberated, JP Morgan is anticipating your opinions on these matters.

"Rick:  As a follow up to our discussion on headcount reduction, as you know, there are several important fiduciary functions that the Portfolio group performs related to the existing asset portfolio that should be performed until the assets are sold:  Review and audit of contractually required fundings for capital and operating expenditures (we usually recover $$$)) Maintenance of compliance system to ensure compliance with reporting requirements and transaction covenants Maintenance of the PortRAC system that is used for asset management, data rooms and Board reporting Post transaction reviews as directed by Management and the Board  In addition to our obligation to management and shareholders, JEDI II and CalPERS look to RAC to make sure that the Commercial Teams are maximizing value. In my opinion, some staff should be maintained to perform these functions or value and the ability to sell these assets will be compromised. I am available to discuss at your convenience.","Salutations Rick, This email explores further our previous discussion on headcount reduction. There are several vital fiduciary functions that the Portfolio group performs in regards to the existing asset portfolio. These functions should be performed until the assets are sold. Review and audit of contractually required funding for capital and operating expenditures is a one of the functions. We have a high chance of recovering money during this time. Another function is Maintenance, which maintains the compliance system to ensure compliance with reporting requirements and transaction covenants. Maintenance of the PortRAC system is another function. This system is an important step for asset management, data rooms, and Board reporting post transaction reviews. These reviews are directed by Management and the Board. Besides our obligation to management and shareholders, JEDI II and CalPERS examine RAC to ensure that the Commercial Teams are maximizing value. Therefore, I propose that some staff should be maintained to perform these aforementioned functions or the value of the assets, along with the ability to sell, may become compromised. I am free to engage in discourse concerning this matter at your earliest convenience  ",Could you make this more formal?,formality
"We looked at the c8 flare that happened on 9/26/2000 at 19:49 UT, which was watched by the soho/sumer spectrometer from beginning to end. The emission first started decaying through the equilibrium states, one-by-one until the plasma hit 2-3mk. A set of cooler lines then appeared in the temperature range @xmath0 under the equilibrium conditions. Those lines all appeared and and grew in the same ways. This shows us how emissions can form at the same time with different initial temperatures, due to the heat variables which happen when the flaring plasma cools to less than @xmath1mk. Using this knowledge, we can accurately place the start times of each light curve line with a model of a single flaring loop. This helps us model the light curves much more accurately and predict slower growth of line emissions, assuming that the model loop is actually a bunch of subloops heated at slightly different times. All of this will be good to know when studying future flares with sdo/eve. ","In the present work we study the c8 flare occurred on september 26, 2000 at 19:49 ut and observed by the soho / sumer spectrometer from the beginning of the impulsive phase to well beyond the disappearance in the x - rays. The emission first decayed progressively through equilibrium states until the plasma reached 2 - 3 mk. Then, a series of cooler lines, i.e.,,, and ( formed in the temperature range @xmath0 under equilibrium conditions ), are emitted at the same time and all evolve in a similar way. Here we show that the simultaneous emission of lines with such a different formation temperature is due to thermal instability occurring in the flaring plasma as soon as it has cooled below @xmath1 mk. We can qualitatively reproduce the relative start time of the light curves of each line in the correct order with a simple ( and standard ) model of a single flaring loop. The agreement with the observed light curves is greatly improved, and a slower evolution of the line emission is predicted, if we assume that the model loop consists of an ensemble of subloops or strands heated at slightly different times.

The family of antisymmetric modes doesn’t endure bifurcations and has both stable and unstable portions. Just how unstable localized modes comes about is looked into by straight mockups.

"Now, offshore places could cause some danger for species as they migrate or change important habitat for feeding, breeding, and nursing. Info on accidental encounters and death rates is low, cause of the little number of places working in offshore areas. NOAA has started looking into longline sea gear that could be used by mussel and found that the encounters are rare. Yet, researches wonder if the little number of encounters seems to mean that this type of sea gear is harmless or it doesn't report all of its encounters with sea life. Belittling what happens on protected species may need more looking into and study the natural encounters between predator and prey. So, management plans might need to do more preventative measures, like as spatial planning on sea gear changes.","Offshore facilities could affect some endangered species as they migrate or alter essential habitat for feeding, breeding, and nursing.

"Here are the first mass measurements of lyman-@xmath0 galaxies moving away from us at high speeds.  We looked at details from nine different galaxies from four different surveys and came up with velocity measurements.  These measurements allow us to study lyman-@xmath0 galaxies on a super-galactic scale.  The resulting masses fall between the @xmath1 to @xmath2 scales.  We also compared our models to star population models and used them to compare our models to reality.  In general, the lyman-@xmath0 galaxies follow the patterns we see when we look at other galaxies.  In all of the different xmath cases we tried, the masses in our models generally agreed with what we see in reality.  However, when we used the dynamic masses as an upper limit on gas mass, we saw that the lyman-@xmath0 galaxies actually look more like starbusts than normal galaxies in terms of their densities and star formations.  Finally, we found that these galaxies will probably have to undergo ""wet"" merging at some point in their future.  In short, we've found that lyman-@xmath0 galaxies are essentially just low mass cousins of bigger starbursts.","We present the first dynamical mass measurements for lyman-@xmath0 galaxies at high redshift, based on velocity dispersion measurements from rest - frame optical emission lines and size measurements from hst imaging, for a sample of nine galaxies drawn from four surveys. These measurements enable us to study the nature of lyman-@xmath0 galaxies in the context of galaxy scaling relations. The resulting dynamical masses range from @xmath1 to @xmath2. We also fit stellar population models to our sample, and use them to plot the lyman-@xmath0 sample on a stellar mass vs. line width relation. Overall, the lyman-@xmath0 galaxies follow well the scaling relation established by observing star forming galaxies at lower redshift ( and without regard for lyman-@xmath0 emission ), though in @xmath3 of the lyman-@xmath0 galaxies, lower - mass fits are also acceptable. In all cases, the _ dynamical _ masses agree with established _ stellar _ mass - linewidth relation. Using the dynamical masses as an upper limit on gas mass, we show that lyman-@xmath0 galaxies resemble starbursts ( rather than `` normal'' galaxies ) in the relation between gas mass surface density and star formation activity, in spite of relatively modest star formation rates. Finally, we examine the mass densities of these galaxies, and show that their future evolution likely requires dissipational ( `` wet'' ) merging.

"Many harpsichords have exactly one string per note. There are several reasons why it is sometimes an advantage to have more. When there are two choirs of strings at the same length, it is possible to arrange for them to give different tonal qualities, and thus to increase the variety of sound produced by the instrument. This is done by having one set of strings plucked closer to the nut, which emphasizes the higher harmonics, and produces a ""nasal"" sound quality. When two strings tuned to the same pitch, or to an octave apart, are plucked simultaneously by a single keystroke, the note is louder and richer than one produced by a single string. The qualitative distinction is particularly noticeable when the strings are tuned an octave apart.","While many harpsichords have exactly one string per note, more elaborate harpsichords can have more. This provides two advantages: the ability to vary volume and the ability to vary tonal quality. Volume is increased when the mechanism of the instrument is set up by the player (see below) so that the press of a single key plucks more than one string. Tonal quality can be varied in two ways. Second, having one key pluck two strings at once changes not just volume but also tonal quality; for instance, when two strings tuned to the same pitch are plucked simultaneously, the note is not just louder but also richer and more complex. A particularly vivid effect is obtained when the strings plucked simultaneously are an octave apart.",Rewrite the section to add clarity.,wiki

"As early as 1948, Melitta Schmideberg observed that emotionally deprived parents may unconsciously regard their children as parental figures'. ""Spousification"" and ""parental child"" (Minuchin) offered new routes to explore the same phenomenon, while the theme of 'intergenerational continuity of boundary violations' in parentification was also identified. For practical reasons, elder children are generally chosen for the familial ""parental"" role. Where there is a disabled child in the family to be cared for, 'older siblings, especially girls, are at the greatest risk of parentification'. It is a betrayal of the child's trust in her mother to love her and take care of her '.' A great drawback of parentification is the loss of one's own childhood 'Instead,' destructively parentified children assume excessive responsibility for other family members and often for the family as a whole. 'Parentified children may struggle with lingering resentment, explosive anger and difficulty in forming trusting relationships with peers'-traits that may end up 'following them into adulthood. Forming close, trusting romantic and spousal relationships may be difficult for adults who were parentified as children'. Not all results of parentification are negative.","Melitta Schmideberg noted in 1948 how emotional deprivation could lead parents to treat their children (unconsciously) as substitute parent figures. ""Spousification"" and ""parental child"" (Minuchin) offered alternative concepts exploring the same phenomenon; while the theme of intergenerational continuity in such violations of personal boundaries was further examined. Alternatively a widower may put a daughter into the social and emotional role of his dead wife-""spousification""; or a mother can oblige her daughter to play the caring role, in a betrayal of the child's normal expectation of love and care. Narcissistic parentification occurs when a child is forced to take on the parent's idealised projection, something which encourages a compulsive perfectionism in the child at the expence of their natural development. In a kind of pseudo-identification, the child is induced by any and all means to take on the characteristics of the parental ego ideal-a pattern that has been detected in western culture since Homer's description of the character of Achilles. The almost inevitable byproduct of parentification is losing one's own childhood. In extreme instances, there may be what has been called a kind of disembodiment, a narcissistic wound that threatens one's basic self-identity. In later life, parentified children may be left struggling with unacknowledged anger and resentment, may have difficulty trusting their peers, and may end up struggling to form and maintain romantic relationships. However, not all results of parentification may be negative.",Rewrite with more paraphrasing and examples.,wiki

"A turn less than 360 ° is often called a pivot. Multiple, consecutive rotations are typically named according to the number of complete rotations, e.g. double turn or triple turn. Spotting technique is typically used during turns.

This gives the impression that the head is always facing forwards and presents a more dynamic looking turn. It also prevents dizziness by allowing the head to stay stable for longer. Typically, a single (360 °) turn begins facing forward, whereas 540 ° turns begin facing forward and end facing back, or start facing the left diagonal front and end facing the right diagonal front.","A turn less than 360 ° is sometimes called a pivot.

"As the number of visual objects increases, the information available for each object will decrease due to less cognitive processing, hence task relevant objects must bias the competition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that attention effects at a neuron level can be explained using ‘’ bias competition theory ’’. The attention can be said to bias the internal weight toward the attended object and is shown by an increase in oxygenated blood to that neuron. Further support comes from neurophysiological studies which suggest that attention results from top-down biasing which has been shown to influence neuron spiking.

"Lipids are usually made up of a molecule of glycerol and other molecules. In triglycerides, or the main lipid, there is one molecule of glycerol, and three fatty acids. Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and could be saturated (no double bonds in the carbon chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bond in the carbon chain). Lipids, especially phospholipids, are also used in different pharmaceutical products, either as co-solubilisers e.g. in Parenteral infusions or else as drug carrier components (e.g. in a Liposome or Transfersome). Proteins are macro biopolymers, and have monomers of amino acids. There are 20 standard amino acids, and they contain a carboxyl group, an amino group, and a side chain (or an ""R"" group). The ""R"" group is what makes each amino acid different, and the properties of the side chains greatly influence the overall three-dimensional confirmation of a protein. When Amino acids combine, they form a special bond called a peptide bond through dehydration synthesis, and become a polypeptide, or a protein.

"Brown's Station, New York was a village located in the Esopus Valley in southeastern Ulster County, New York. It was the easternmost village in the town of Olive, New York, and was named after Alfred Brown, who owned and tended to the Brown Farm House that was in the village. In the village, there were farms, boarding houses, stores, and even a telegraph office. It was a popular tourist spot. Plenty of people would come from many different areas, especially New York City, to take time off and relax. There were two streams that went through the town; the Esopus Creek and the Beaverkill Creek, which flowed into the Esopus at the end of the village. Tourists and summer / weekend boarders would come to this town to swim in the creeks, along with other activities such as tubing, boating and fishing. The town was served by the Ulster and Delaware Railroad, which had a railroad depot in the town. The depot was also called Brown's Station, and was one of the busiest depots in the Esopus Valley. It was where several carloads of cement were dropped off for the construction of the Ashokan Reservoir. The City of New York had been surveying many places to put a reservoir. They had already impounded part of the Croton River and most of its subsidaries. But they needed more water, and they eventually decided to flood the Esopus Valley. They started building the dam in 1906, and were using Rosendale Cement, the strongest at the time. The cement was dropped off at Brown's Station. When they finished in 1912, they started flooding the valley, and the buildings were either moved or abandoned. The reservoir was completely filled in 1915, and Brown's Station was but a memory.","Brown's Station, New York, is a village that no longer exists. It was located in the Esopus Valley of southeastern Ulster County, New York (USA), and it was submerged by the waters of the Ashokan Reservoir, an artificial lake built between 1906 and 1915 to supply fresh water to New York City. The easternmost village in the town of Olive, New York, Brown's Station was named for Alfred Brown, a prominent local farmer. In the village and its environs, there were farms, boarding houses, shops, and a telegraph office. Two streams flowed through the village: the Esopus Creek and the Beaverkill Creek, which merged, at the downhill end of the village, retaining the name, Esopus Creek. Brown's Station was a popular spot, especially for vacationers from New York City, who would come to swim in the creeks, and to enjoy rafting (using rubber inner tubes), boating, and fishing. The village was served by the Ulster and Delaware Railroad; the railroad depot called Brown's Station, which lent the village its name, was one of the busiest passenger and freight depots in the Esopus Valley. Ironically, the depot at Brown's Station was an instrument of its own demise; shipments of cement were transported there for use in the construction of the Ashokan Reservoir. Having already impounded part of the nearby Croton River and most of its tributaries, agents of the City of New York surveyed a number of places to build another reservoir.

"An example is a market for nails where the cost of each nail is $ 0.10 and the demand decreases linearly, from a high demand for free nails to zero demand for nails at $ 1.10. If the market has perfect competition, producers would have to charge a price of $ 0.10, and every customer whose marginal benefit exceeds $ 0.10 would have a nail. However, if there is one producer with a monopoly on the product, it will charge whatever price will yield the greatest profit. The producer would then charge $ 0.60 and thus exclude every customer who had less than $ 0.60 of marginal benefit. The deadweight loss would then be the economic benefit foregone by such customers because of monopoly pricing. Conversely, deadweight loss can come from consumers if they buy a product even if it costs more than it benefits them. To describe this, if the same nail market had the government been giving a $ 0.03 subsidy to every nail produced, the subsidy would push the market price of each nail down to $ 0.07. Some consumers would then buy nails even though the benefit to them is less than the real cost of $ 0.10. That unneeded expense would then create a deadweight loss, with resources not being used efficiently. In an example of taxes instead of subsidies, if the price of a glass of wine is $ 3.00 and the price of a glass of beer is $ 3.00, a consumer might prefer to drink wine.","Assume a market for nails where the cost of each nail is $ 0.10.

If market conditions are perfect competition, producers would charge a price of $ 0.10, and every customer whose marginal benefit exceeds $ 0.10 would buy a nail. A monopoly producer of this product would typically charge whatever price will yield the greatest profit to them alone.

The deadweight loss due to monopoly pricing would then be the economic benefit foregone by the customer with a marginal benefit of between $ 0.10 and $ 0.60 per nail. The monopolist has ""priced them out of the market"", even though their benefit exceeds the ""true"" cost per nail. Conversely, deadweight loss can arise from consumers buying a product when it costs more to produce than they would benefit from it. For example, if in the same nail market the government provided a $ 0.03 subsidy for every nail produced, the subsidy would reduce the market price of each nail to $ 0.07, even though production actually still costs $ 0.10 per nail.

Similar results have been reported when levofloxacin is co-administered with iron supplements and multi-vitamins containing zinc.

"Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure (force per unit area) exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels, and constitutes one of the principal vital signs. The pressure of the circulating blood decreases as it moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries, and toward the heart through veins. When unqualified, the term blood pressure usually refers to brachial arterial pressure: that is, in the major blood vessel of the upper left or right arm that takes blood away from the heart. Blood pressure may, however, sometimes be measured at other sites in the body, for instance at the ankle. The ratio of the blood pressure measured in the main artery at the ankle to the brachial blood pressure gives the Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI). Arterial pressure is most commonly measured via a sphygmomanometer, which historically used the height of a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure (see Noninvasive measurement). Today blood pressure values are still reported in millimetres of mercury (mmHg), though aneroid and electronic devices do not use mercury. For each heartbeat, blood pressure varies between systolic and diastolic pressures.","Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels, and is one of the principal vital signs. During each heartbeat, BP varies between a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure.

"As the shell moves down the barrel during firing, it creates a high pressure in front of the projectile and the evacuator is filled with high pressure air through the holes. As the shell passes farther, the pressure behind it begins to drop, and suddenly returns nearly to atmospheric pressure as the shell leaves the barrel. During this process the high-pressure air in the reservoir begins to blow back into the barrel towards the front of the gun tube. By aiming these holes forward, their exhaust causes the pressurized air to be blown forward and out of the barrel, extracting fumes from the barrel.","When the gun is fired, high pressure gas generated by the burning propellant pushes the projectile forwards. When the projectile passes the holes drilled into the barrel, the propellant gasses are free to flow into the reservoir.

"Group Formation: groups are often picked at random, or they are determined by what members have similar schedules. Picking groups at random is an effective way to ensure diversity in the group. Groups formed based on who has similar schedules is often a smart choice to ensure members of the group are able to meet in person to write on the collaborative piece. Organization: working with others functions smoothly when there are deadlines, goals, and predetermined meetings are set in place.

"A number of α5IA analogues exist that, like α5IA, selectively and partially agonize some GABA receptor subtypes while inverse agonizing others, which may provide a nootropic effect without the associated anxiogenic effects of general GABA inverse agonism. The AMPA transmitter and the AMPA receptors are currently being researched, and there are signs that significant memory improvement and possible alertness enhancement may occur when agonized. The drug class for AMPA system modulation is called Ampakines. Although there are many Ampakines currently in-research, those mentioned here are significantly notable, and / or show reasonable signs of coming to market.

"They can also manifest biochemical changes, including the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or the up-regulation of genes producing other defensive enzymes, many of which are toxic to pathogens or herbivores (16,17,18,2). Jasmonates are a class of VOCs produced by the jasmonic acid pathway, which are used in plant defense against insects and pathogens and can cause the expression of proteases which defend against insect attack (18). Plants have many ways to react to attack, including VOCs, which studies report can coordinate defenses among plants connected by mycorrhizal networks. A plant sharing a mycorrhizal network with another that is attacked will display similar defensive strategies and will increase the production of toxins or chemicals which repel attackers or attract defensive species. Terpenoids are a large class of VOCs existing constituently in plants or made as a response to stress, which act much like methyl salicytate, and AM fungus can activate plant defensive reactions, called priming, by causing them to increase the production of terpinoids.","They can also manifest biochemical changes, including the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or the up-regulation of genes producing other defensive enzymes, many of which are toxic to pathogens or herbivores (16,17,18,2).

"The Singapore Army (,;) is the branch of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) defending Singapore by land military operations. It is the largest of the three armed services. The SAF is mainly a conscript army and most of its units are manned by reserves. The mission of the Army is to deter aggression, and should deterrence fail, to secure a swift and decisive victory. In peacetime, the Army is to be ready and capable of conducting a spectrum of operations to protect Singapore's national interests and the well-being of its citizens. The Singapore Army focuses on leveraging technology and weapon systems as ""force-multipliers"". Aside from hardware, the Singapore Army heavily invests in its ""software"". Largely made up of tertiary-educated conscripts and career regular soldiers, who are continually upgrading their skills with higher education, well-trained and technically proficient. To familiarise all soldiers with practical fighting experience in case of national exigencies, military exercises up to division level are conducted many times annually, training almost all combat NS units to full-spectrum, full-scale war scenario stimulation. Divisional exercises involve the integration of the national air force and navy to train its troopers with its combined arms, tri-service joint operations. Due to space constraints, some large-scale exercises are conducted overseas unilaterally. Reservists (NSmen) take part in overseas exercises periodically and there is constant evaluation on NS units to improve their operational readiness. Bilateral training and exchanges are also common between friendly nations. The Singapore Army is currently undergoing the transformation into a 3rd Generation fighting force. The SAF's evolution into its 3rd Generation involves combining advances in technology and training while using networking to integrate the tri-services into an integrated fighting force. This will provide even greater operational-readiness and flexibility during war and peace time.","The Singapore Army (,;) is the branch of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) tasked with land land operations. It is the largest of the three service branches. The SAF is primarily a conscript army that, in the event of war, mobilizes most of its combat power by calling up military reservists. The mission of the Singapore Armed Forces is to deter armed aggression, and to secure a swift and decisive victory should deterrence fail. Additionally, the Army is tasked with conducting peace-time operations in furtherance of Singapore's national interests and foreign policy. These range from disaster relief to peacekeeping, hostage-rescue and other contingencies. The Army views technology as a force-multiplier and a means to sustain combat power given Singapore's population constraints. Jointness across three branches of the SAF is integral to the Army's warfighting doctrine. Joint operations the Army has undertaken with the Navy and Air Force include amphibious landings and critical disaster relief in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The Army has a technically proficient, relatively well-educated draftee pool and officer corps (non-commissioned and commissioned) reflective of the population at large, and has sought to leverage this to ease its transition into a more sophisticated, networked fighting force. Combat readiness is a linchpin of Army policy, and military exercises up to divisional level are conducted many times yearly, simulating full-spectrum operations, up to and including full-scale war. Divisional war games are a combined arms, tri-service affair involving the Republic of Singapore Navy and Air Force. Because training space is limited in Singapore - artillery fire would quickly traverse the island, for example - some military exercises are conducted overseas. Reservists periodically train abroad, their units regularly evaluated for combat readiness. The Army also trains bilaterally with some host nations, and military exchanges are frequent. Training is billed as ""tough, realistic and safe,"" with a premium on safety, given the sensitivity of military deaths in a largely conscript army. Following the Revolution in Military Affairs, and in tandem with modernizing its weapons systems, the Army is forging a transition to a more network-centric fighting doctrine that better integrates the Air Force and Navy.","Copyedit for flow, and readability.",wiki

"The level also contains a very interesting block of andesite with relief-texture. Recent research has proved that this stone was used as a melting pot for copper. The stone was not brought here from outside but was part of the andesite layer unearthened while hollowing. To be able to use it as a melting pot, 57 holes were carved on the surface of the stone. The copper ore, about 10 cm in length, would be put into one of those holes and would be hammered using a hard piece of rock. This technique has been known since the Prehistoric Periods. The copper brought to Kaymakli Underground City was probably dug from a quarry between Aksaray and Nevsehir. The fact that there are a lot of storage rooms and places to put earthenware jars in the wineries on the 4th floor indicates that the people living in this underground city were economically stable.

"Richards, was an influential English literary critic and rhetorician. He was educated at Clifton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his love of English was nurtured by the scholar Charles Hickson 'Cabby' Spence. His books, especially The Meaning of Meaning, Principles of Literary Criticism, Practical Criticism, and The Philosophy of Rhetoric, proved to be founding influences for the New Criticism. The concept of 'practical criticism' led in time to the practices of close reading, what is often thought of as the beginning of modern literary criticism. Richards is regularly considered one of the founders of the contemporary study of literature in English. Richards began his career without formal training in literature at all; he studied philosophy (""moral sciences"") at Cambridge University. Richards 'earliest teaching appointments were in the equivalent of what might be called ""adjunct faculty"" positions; Magdalene College at Cambridge would not pay a salary to Richards to teach the new and untested field of English literature. Instead, Richards collected tuition directly from the students as they entered the classroom each week. In 1926 he married Dorothy Pilley Richards, whom he had met on a climbing holiday in Wales. Richards' life and influence can be divided into periods, which correspond roughly to his intellectual interests. An assessment of Richards 'work and biography requires mention of C. K.Ogden, collaborator on three of the most important projects of Richards' life and work.

"The Id dominates, because neither the ego nor the super ego is yet fully developed, and, since the infant has no personality (identity), every action is based upon the pleasure principle; nonetheless, the ego is developing during the Oral stage. Therefore, the infant gradually understands that gratification sometimes is delayed, and that he or she must behave in ways certain to lead to gratification of desire, e.g. crying proves productive to gratifying certain needs. Weaning is the infant’s key experience during the Oral stage of psychosexual development, his or her first feeling of loss consequent to losing the physical intimacy of feeding at the mother’s breast. Yet, weaning also increases the infant’s self-awareness upon learning that not everything is under his or her control, and thus learns of delayed gratification. In the second stage of psychosexual development, the gratification of needs leads to the formation of independence (awareness of the limits of the self) and the capacity to trust (specific behaviors lead to gratification). An Oral-stage fixation can lead to passivity, gullibility, immaturity, unrealistic optimism, and the formation of a manipulative personality consequent to the improper formation of the ego, resulting either from too much or too little gratification of desire. In the case of too much gratification, the child does not learn that he or she does not control the environment, and that gratification is not always immediate (the result of weaning), thereby forming an immature personality. In the case of too little gratification of desire, the infant might become passive upon learning that gratification is not forthcoming, despite having produced the gratifying behavior.","The Id dominates, because neither the ego nor the super ego is yet fully developed, and, since the infant has no personality (identity), every action is based upon the pleasure principle.

"As a result of this the systems are themselves chiral and will often react differently to the different enantiomers of a given compound. However studies have shown that only the (S)-(+) enantiomer is responsible for this effect. As such enantioselctive synthesis is of great importance. However it can also be difficult to achieve, as enantiomers possess identical energies and hence should produce them in equal amounts by an undirected process, leading to a racemic mixture. In enantioselective synthesis the formation of one enantiomer is promoted by making its transition state lower in energy than that of the opposing enantiomer. This is achieved by making the environment around the transition state chiral; a process known as asymmetric induction. This can involve the influence of chiral feature present in the substrate, reagent, catalyst or environment.","As a result of this living systems possess a high degree of chemical chirality and will often react differently to the various enantiomers of a given compound.

"According to Seligman, the more happy people are, the less they are focused on the negative. They also tend to like others more, which creates an overall happiness which then correlates to a higher level of satisfaction with their life. However, others have found that life satisfaction is compatible with profoundly negative emotional states like depression (Carson 1981). A test was designed to measure participants ’ability to recall a specific memory in response to a cue word while being timed. They presented a list of 30 words to a focus group, who identified which words were more familiar positive, negative, and neutral. These words were presented orally to the participant. Words were presented in a fixed, alternating order. To make sure the participants understood the instructions, they provided examples of general memory (e.g., summers in the city) and specific memory (e.g., the day I got married). In this test, participants were asked to share a memory that the cue word reminded them of, one that should have occurred at a particular time and place and lasted no longer than a day. Participants were given 30 seconds to produce a memory. If no memory was recalled in 30 seconds, it was not counted. Each memory was rated on whether it was general or specific. If the recalled event lasted no longer than a day, it was rated as specific. If the memory happened on a number of occasions, it was rated as general. Two psychologists served as raters and independently scored the responses of all participants; The raters were not aware of the hypotheses of the study, the experimental or control group, and the pretest or posttest.","According to Seligman, the happier people are, the less they are focused on the negative.

"Many species found within Echinaster are red, orange, or pink in nature. Life history and lifespan are attributed to many different factors. Some of these factors include variation in reproduction such as: egg size, embryonic development, parental investment, larval type, etc. Echinaster are able to start reproduction by broadcast spawning gametes into the water. They mostly produce brachiolaria (one type) larvae who are lecithotropic, non-feeding larvae, which tend to be larger but produced in fewer numbers than plankotrophic larvae. Some Echinaster produce eggs which are bipinnaria plus brachiolaria.","Many species found within Echinaster are red, orange, or pink in coloration. Sea stars can live up to 35 years in the wild under the proper conditions, but the lifespans of Echinaster can be variable and affected by environmental factors such as salinity, temperature of water, light availability, and pollution. Furthermore, the lifespan of an Echinaster can also be affected by humans. Habitat destruction and overfishing are two factors which have adverse affects on populations of Echinaster. Echinaster are able to start reproduction by broadcast spawning gametes into the water, where externally fertilized eggs develop into planktonic larvae. Most species only produce brachiolaria larvae which are lecithotropic, non-feeding larvae. However, some Echinaster produce larvae which first go through a smaller, feeding bipinnaria stage, and then through the second brachiolaria larval stage.",Expand upon the Life History and Reproduction sections,wiki

"Daria fandom was marked through its entire run by shipper debate. From the series' first season, the main conflict was over whether the title character, Daria Morgendorffer, should have a relationship with Trent Lane, a slacker rock-band frontman, whom Daria met through his sister, Jane. A common argument against this possible outcome was that such a development would signal a turn away from the more subversive aspects of Daria's character, such as bitter criticism of romantic relationships, and thus the show. The show's writers responded by having Daria develop a crush on Trent. Trent, however, remained involved with his off-and-on girlfriend Monique, who immediately became a target of shipper ire.

Since the rotation of the horizontal tube creates a centrifugal force towards the tube walls, the liquid drop starts to be elongated and this elongation stops when the interfacial tension and centrifugal forces are balanced. Values obtained at this equilibrium point are used to estimate surface tension of the particular liquid by using appropriate correlations.",Add more desciptions of how the spinning drop method works.,wiki

"Cigarette smoke has been observed to globally alter histone modifications of promoter regions of pro-inflammatory genes, mainly through an overall increase in acetylation. Specifically in rat and mouse models, cigarette smoke was observed to increase acetylation of lysine 9 on H3 (H3K9) and lysine 12 on H4 (H4K12) but also phosphorylation of serine 10 on H3 (H3S10). These marks are associated with an increase in gene expression and prevent the accumulation of epigenetic marks that promote gene repression. Mechanistically, the increased frequency of these marks, especially the modifications on histone H3, is linked to the activation of IKK-α that directly phosphorylates histone H3 as a consequence of exposure to cigarette smoke.","Cigarette smoke has been observed to globally alter histone modifications near the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory genes, mainly through an overall increase in acetylation. Cigarette smoke can alter histone acetylation through a number of pathways. Chief among these is the degradation of HDAC2, thereby preventing the removal of acetylation marks in affected cells. The degradation of this enzyme results from phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination induced by cigarette smoke.

"Estuarine systems also experience daily, tidal and seasonal swings in temperature, which affects many of the chemical characteristics of the water as well as the metabolic and calcifying processes of shell-producing organisms. The temperature and salinity affect the carbonate balance of the water, influencing carbonate equilibrium, calcium carbonate solubility and the saturation states of calcite and aragonite. Tidal influences and shallow waters ensure that estuarine organisms experience wide variations in the temperature, salinity and other aspects of water chemistry, making this habitat ideal for studies on the influence of changing physical and chemical conditions on processes such as shell deposition. Changing conditions in estuaries and coastal regions is especially important since around 50% of global calcification and 90% of fish catch occurs in these locations. A large number of the larger calcifying organisms are molluscs, such as bivalves, cephalopods, chitons, and gastropods.","Estuarine systems also experience daily, tidal and seasonal swings in temperature, which affect many of the chemical characteristics of the water and in turn affect the metabolic and calcifying processes of shell-producing organisms.

On March 30, 2002, Pinto faced a women's boxing world champion for the first time. In only her third bout, she lost to Para Draine by a four round decision in Tacoma, Washington. Pinto then lost to Marilyn Salcido, then considered a future women's boxing star, by a four round decision, in Laughlin, Nevada, on April 21. On June 27, she faced Nicole Salazar, winning a four round decision over Salazar, who was making her professional boxing debut that night, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Pinto retired from boxing after a four round draw (tie) in Cornwall, Ontario against Heather Stevens. In what can perhaps be considered an irony, her last career fight was also her first fight in her home country.

"Many clinics also publish brochures, booklets, pamphlets and fact sheets for the benefit of the general public. Specialty clinics provide low-income individuals with assistance in a specific area of law not normally covered by the general community legal clinics. Specialty clinics will typically provide summary legal advice and free representation to clients who meet their eligibility guidelines. Specialty clinics also provide legal assistance to, and consult with, private bar lawyers, MPPs and community agencies. Student Legal Aid Services Societies (SLASS) clinics are designed to provide law students with practical legal training and experience. Staffed by law students under the supervision of lawyers, SLASS clinics provide legal advice and representation on matters such as criminal law, tenant issues, employee's rights and small claims court. In partnership with the legal profession, the provincial government passed the Law Society Amendment Act, 1951. The plan outlined the creation of a small fund to cover its operation, however lawyers who provided assistance did so entirely pro-bono and without any remuneration for their services. In 1967, modeled on similar doctrines in England and Scotland, the Legal Aid Act was passed. Several major changes from the Law Society Amendment Act saw the division of responsibility between the province and the Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC) in the funding and management of legal assistance. The act also initiated the development of the certificate and duty counsel program and addressed what types of offences would be covered, with criminal offences that faced a serious risk of incarceration and family matters in the Superior Court both provided for.

"This is a LIM-launched roller coaster that is essentially the same ride as the Mr. Freeze roller coaster at Six Flags St. Louis, only in mirror image. Originally this coaster had over the shoulder restraints that were replaced with individual ratcheting lap bars in 2002.

The ride starts with the brakes releasing and the lights come on. Then the LIMs launch the train out of a 120 'tunnel which is immediately followed by an inside tophat. The third element is an over the banked left turn followed by the last element: a spike where the train is lifted to the top by LIMs. At the top the train stalls then runs the course in reverse.

"When a hormone binds to the receptor, it results in the activation of a signal transduction pathway that typically activates gene transcription, resulting in increased expression of target proteins; non-genomic effects are more rapid, and can be synergistic with genomic effects. Hormone secretion may occur in many tissues. Endocrine glands provide the cardinal example, but specialized cells in various other organs also secrete hormones. Hormone secretion occurs in response to specific biochemical signals from a wide range of regulatory systems. Regulation of hormone synthesis of gonadal hormones, adrenocortical hormones, and thyroid hormones often depends on complex sets of direct-influence and feedback interactions involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), -gonadal (HPG), and -thyroid (HPT) axes. Upon secretion, certain hormones, including protein hormones and catecholamines, are water-soluble and are thus readily transported through the circulatory system. Other hormones, including steroid and thyroid hormones, are lipid-soluble; to achieve widespread distribution, these hormones must bond to carrier plasma glycoproteins (e.g., thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)) to form ligand-protein complexes.","When a hormone binds to the receptor, it results in the activation of a signal transduction pathway that typically activates gene transcription, resulting in increased expression of target proteins. Hormones can also act in rapid, non-genomic pathways that can be synergistic with genomic effects. Water-soluble hormones (such as peptides and amines) generally act on the surface of target cells via second messengers. Lipid soluble hormones (such as steroids) generally pass through the plasma membranes of target cells (both cytoplasmic and nuclear) to act within their nuclei. A notable exception to this are brassinosteroids in plants, which despite being lipid soluble, still bind to their receptor at the cell surface. In vertebrates, endocrine glands are specialized organs that secrete hormones into the endocrine signaling system. Hormone secretion occurs in response to specific biochemical signals and is often subject to negative feedback regulation. For instance, high blood sugar (serum glucose concentration) promotes insulin synthesis. Insulin then acts to reduce glucose levels and maintain homeostasis, leading to reduced insulin levels. Upon secretion, water soluble hormones are readily transported through the circulatory system. Lipid-soluble hormones must bond to carrier plasma glycoproteins (e.g., thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)) to form ligand-protein complexes.",Reorganize and reword some of the intro,wiki

"Reverse transcriptase’s (RT) goal is to produce a complementary DNA from an RNA template. A reverse transcriptase in a retrovirus transcribes their single-stranded RNA into a single-stranded DNA and constructs a complimentary strand of that DNA resulting in a double helix that is capable of integrating into host cell chromosomes1. In physiological conditions Mg2 + acts as the cofactor, but there are other divalent cations used for nucleotide catalysis such as, Ni2 + and Cu2 +. Zinc is an effective inhibitor of many enzymes including many viral polymerases. An experiment had shown that Zn2 + showed both polymerase and ribonuclease-H activity at lower concentrations than Mg2 + and that Zn2 + was an effective inhibitor of reverse transcriptase when Mg2 + was present.","Reverse transcriptases (RT) are a class of enzymes that produce a complementary DNA strand from an RNA template.

Zinc is an effective inhibitor of many viral polymerases, amongst other enzymes. A 2011 experiment using enzyme kinetics showed that RT possessed both polymerase and ribonuclease-H activity when Zn2 + was used as the cofactor. Although the enzyme would function at lower concentrations of Zn2 + compared to Mg2 +, the rates of catalysis were approximately 35 times slower. In addition, only a small amount of Zn2 + was needed to reduce enzyme activity, even when larger concentrations of Mg2 + were present. The authors concluded that Zn2 + was an effective inhibitor of reverse transcriptase when Mg2 + is present due to the severe decrease in catalysis rates.",Expand on the concepts presented,wiki

"Of the many Categories of blends found through out the world, the most prominent use of Latakia are those of the English Pipe Tobacco variety. So much so that to be considered an English mixture, it must contain some percentage of Latakia tobacco. English pipe mixtures became so famous for the distinct flavor of latakia due to its rarity and expense. Because the British Empire had interests within Syria and the surrounding areas, the import of latakia as well as other oriental tobaccos to the British Isles were common place but not much elsewhere in western Europe and the Americas. Much like many tobacco blends, the basis is made of a combination of Virginia Tobacco or Burley Tobacco either by themselves or blended together. In modern pipe smoking, latakia can be found in many blends and is used more widely used since its establishment in Cyprus.

Yaw control on both was effected through changing the difference in rotational speed between the two rotors, using a series of disc brakes. A small tail surface provided directional stability in forward flight. The smaller rotor spins at a higher rpm, with about 60 percent of the load. The main rotor is adjustable for lift control. The NH-160 proved to be much more stable in tests than the NH-120 which had a higher center of gravity.",Copyedit for cohesion and flow; change the order of a few paragraphs and/or sections.,wiki

"In the early stage of hydroelectric development on the Fraser’s tributaries, little focus was paid to the impact on surrounding ecosystems and salmon habitats of the river and its tributaries. Even when construction was underway, there was little realization of the extent the Kenny dam and smelter plant would have on the Nechako River region. Such impacts included deforestation, disruption of existing ecosystems during the construction of the transmission line to BC’s coast, and habitat loss during the flooding land for the dam’s reservoir. In the BC fisheries industry’s efforts to protect the livelihood of sockeye salmon populations to protect the economic sector of the province, little attention was paid to the environmental effects separate from fishery concerns.

"The general theme is a family history which highlights the differences between father and son, duty to the public over family, and the trials and tribulations of women, particularly of courtesans. Author Ashis Nandy noted that, apart from the conflict between Akbar and his son, there is also an ""unwritten alliance"" between Akbar and Bahar that compounds the problem for Anarkali. He also said that it highlighted the ""idea of justice and the notion of unconditional love"" to uphold tradition. The song ""Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya"" rendered by Anarkali is an indication of her defiance of societal norms. A notable change in the theme is that while the earlier films made on Anarakali on the basis on Imtiaz Ali Taj’s story ended as tragedies, K.Asif gave a happy ending to the film.

"This relative change, from a lower gear to a higher gear, is normally expressed as a percentage. This measure is independent of what system is used to measure the gears. Cycling tends to feel more comfortable if nearly all gear changes have more or less the same percentage difference; a larger percentage difference may be acceptable for lower gears where the absolute difference is not too large. Modern derailers can handle such combinations. Racing cyclists often have close-range gears with a difference of around 7%. Many general-purpose gears have a difference of around 15%. Differences of 25% or more require a very substantial change in cadence and often feel excessive.","This relative change, from a lower gear to a higher gear, is normally expressed as a percentage and is independent of what system is used to measure the gears.

To achieve such consistent relative differences the absolute gear ratios should be in logarithmic progression. Because sprockets must have a whole number of teeth it is impossible to achieve a perfect progression; for example, the seven sprockets 14-16-18-21-24-28-32 have an average step size of around 15% but with actual steps varying between 12.5% and 16.7%.

"Thus, in each step, the liquid-cooled engine has half the temperature difference and so may need as much as twice the cooling area. Properties of the coolant (water, oil, or air) also affect cooling. The thermal conductivity of water is about 4 times that of oil, which can aid heat transfer, and the viscosity of oil can be ten times greater than water, increasing the energy required to perform oil cooling and thus decreasing the power output of oil-cooled engines. Comparing air, oil, and water, air has vastly lower heat capacity per gram or per volume and less than a tenth the conductivity, but also much lower viscosity. Air cooling thus relies on a tornado of air to remove the heat, but getting heat directly to a large surface area for cooling can present its own difficulties and limitations. Water also has the property that it boils from liquid to gas at a useful temperature for cooling engines which have overheated.","In each step, the liquid-cooled engine has half the temperature difference and, so at first appears to need twice the cooling area. However, the properties of the coolant (water, oil, or air) also affect cooling. The thermal conductivity of water is about four times that of oil, which can aid heat transfer. The viscosity of oil can be ten times greater than water, increasing the energy required to pump oil for cooling and taking away from the net power output of the engine. Comparing air and water, air has vastly lower heat capacity per gram and volume and less than a tenth of the conductivity, but also much lower viscosity. Air cooling thus relies on a tornado of air to remove heat. Moving heat from the cylinder to a large surface area for air cooling can present difficulties and limitations. Water boils at about its operating temperature. This has the advantage that it absorbs a great deal of energy with very little temperature rise (heat of vaporization), which is good for keeping things cool. However, once water boils, it is an insulator, leading to a sudden loss of cooling where steam bubbles form (heat transfer). Unfortunately, steam may return to the water as it mixes with other coolants, so the engine temperature gauge can indicate an acceptable temperature even though local damage is being done.","Rewrite the text for clarity, conciseness, and to remove redundancies.

"In astrophysics, gravitational redshift or Einstein shift is the process by which electromagnetic waves / electromagnetic radiation originating from a source that is in gravitational field is reduced in frequency, or redshifted, when observed in a region of a weaker gravitational field. This is as a direct result of Gravitational time dilation. If applied to optical wavelengths this manifests itself as a change in the colour of visible light as the wavelength of the light is increased toward the red part of the light spectrum. Since frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional this is equivalent to saying that the frequency of the light is reduced towards the red part of the light spectrum. There is a corresponding reduction in energy when electromagnetic radiation is red shifted, as given by Planck's relation, due to the electromagnetic radiation propogating in opposition to the gravitational gradient.","In astrophysics, gravitational redshift or Einstein shift is the process by which electromagnetic radiation originating from a source that is in gravitational field is reduced in frequency, or redshifted, when observed in a region of a weaker gravitational field.

"A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space. Near solar maxima, the Sun produces about three CMEs every day, whereas near solar minima, there is about one CME every five days. Coronal mass ejections, along with solar flares of other origin, can disrupt radio transmissions and cause damage to satellites and electrical transmission line facilities, resulting in potentially massive and long-lasting power outages. Before automated monitoring was initiated, CME observations were recorded by visual monitoring. Coronal mass ejections are often associated with other forms of solar activity, most notably solar flares, but a causal relationship has not been established. Most weak flares do not have associated CMEs; most powerful ones do. Most ejections originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such as groupings of sunspots associated with frequent flares.","A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona.

"The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that the nervous system is made up of individual and discrete cells and was formally proposed by Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz in 1891. The ""neuron doctrine"" served to describe neurons as special cases under the broader cell theory proposed decades earlier. Waldeyer based his proposal on the observations of Albert von Kölliker, Camillo Golgi, Franz Nissl, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Auguste Forel, and others rather than upon his own research.","The neuron doctrine is the fundamental idea, formally proposed in 1891 by Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz, that the nervous system is made up of discrete individual cells.

It has a wide range of functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. The liver is necessary for survival; there is currently no way to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term, although new liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term. This gland plays a major role in metabolism and has a number of functions in the body, including glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, plasma protein synthesis, hormone production, and detoxification. It lies below the diaphragm in the abdominal-pelvic region of the abdomen. It produces bile, an alkaline compound which aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids. The liver's highly specialized tissues regulate a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital functions. Estimates regarding the organ's total number of functions vary, but textbooks generally cite it being around 500.","The liver is a vital organ, of vertebrates and some other animals.

"The actual difficulty of performance is considerably varied amongst marches. Because marches were some of the first music to be written for grade school bands (which were just becoming prominent throughout the country), many marches are fairly modest in difficulty. However, given the fact that many composers wrote marches for their own band (typically a professional community or circus band), some require almost virtuoso skill to perform. Many conductors note that any march is difficult to play ""perfectly"", with all correct expressions, articulation, and steady tempo. The following difficulty grading system is adapted from Norman Smith's ""March Music Notes"". Suited for beginner bands who are first approaching music. May even be a simple etude or ditty from an instructional book. Instrumental ranges are comfortable, and most require minimal endurance. Some follow the standard march form, but most are abbreviated, or in a more concert march form. Usually in full march form, this difficulty requires moderate technique and endurance skills. Instrumental range is usually intermediate, and most likely will contain chromatic notes, obbligatos, and counter-melodies. Many Grade 3s are used in actual parade marching. Examples of Grade 3 marches would be ""The Thunderer"" and ""The National Emblem"". Typical high school bands will find this grade requiring a considerable amount of practice / rehearsal. Grade 4s will contain many technically challenging parts and some syncopation. They also tend to require a strict, complete ensemble for proper performance, as they may contain intricate harmonies and counter-melodies. Examples of Grade 4 marches would be ""The Stars and Stripes Forever"" and ""Barnum and Bailey's Favorite"". Usually originally written for professional, virtuoso band members, such as those in a circus band. Therefore, many Grade 5s are Screamers. They are guaranteed to contain woodwind obbligatos or chromatic runs and test the range of any player. May have very quick tempos, as well as complicated rhythms and syncopation. Examples of Grade 5 marches would be ""Entry of the Gladiators"", ""Washington Grays"", and ""Battle of Shiloh"". Usually a Grade 6 is found in a greater piece of work such as a symphony, where it can contain mixed meters, intricate rhythms, and harmonies.","The actual difficulty of performance varies considerably amongst marches.

"The field of metal-based anticancer drugs was initiated by cisplatin, one of the leading agents in clinical use. Cisplatin acts by binding to DNA and forms 1, 2 intrastrand cross-links of the G-G adduct at 70% and the A-G adduct at ~ 20% of the major groves of the DNA duplexes. The planer cis (on the same side) compound is composed of a square molecule with two chloride ligands on one side and two ammonia ligands on the other side centered with the heavy Pt that could initiate the Auger dose in situ. Upon entering the cell with low NaCl concentration, the aqua / chloride ligands would detach from the compound and allows the sites missing chloride to link up G-G or A-G bases and bend the DNA duplexes 45o to result with a damaging 3-D conformation. Since the discovery in 1978, cisplatin has been extended to carboplatin, nedaplatin and oxaliplatin with minor modifications. They are applied as one of the principle drugs in cancer treatments involving as much as 70% of all chemotherapies at approximately $ 2 billion in annual sales. Powerful as they are, the platinum drugs are not particularly effective against certain cancers such as breast and prostate tumors. Conventional cancer treatment is to kill the transformed cancer cells, and not necessarily aim to alter the transformation process. For cells to replicate, their DNA duplexes must be reproduced precisely in each cell cycle using the “Zipper” during mitosis. We aim to make the zipper getting stuck, so to speak, without necessarily killing the cell, and bring the cell into a state of senescence, and achieve a different mode of therapy, perhaps a more effective method of cancer treatment. The second point is that the radiation and chemo dosages are applied to the treatment. Since the DNA genome is a single duplex molecule of 9 billion bases at one meter long without coiling, a single or a few breakages anywhere over the meter long molecule could stop the replication process instead of statistically creating sufficient damages to kill the cell. This senescence rationale would dramatically reduce both the chemo and the radiation doses for reduced side effects as well as deliver the chemo treatment locally as needed. While Ru is much lighter than Pt, it can similarly be induced to provide MegaGy Auger dose in situ, and like Pt drugs to function in the DNA adducts, and could also deliver localized chemo treatments.","The group of metal-based anticancer drugs originated with cisplatin, one of the leading agents in clinical use. Cisplatin acts by binding to DNA, forming one or two intrastrand cross-links of the G-G adduct at 70 percent and the A-G adduct at ~ 20% of the major grooves of the double helix. The planer cis compound (on the same side) is composed of a square molecule with two chloride ligands on one side and two ammonia ligands on the other side, centered with the heavy platinum (Pt) which could initiate the Auger dose in situ. Entering a cell with a low NaCl concentration, the aqua-chloride ligands would detach from the compound (allowing the missing chloride to link the G-G or A-G bases and bend the DNA helixes 45 degrees, damaging them). Since its discovery in 1978, cisplatin has been modified as carboplatin, nedaplatin and oxaliplatin. Although platinum-based antineoplastics are used in as much as 70 percent of all chemotherapy, they are not particularly effective against certain cancers (such as breast and prostate tumors). For cells to replicate, their DNA helixes must be reproduced in each cell cycle using a ""zipper"" during mitosis. With a MegaGy in situ Auger dose, the nanoscale damage would probably exceed any single DNA strand (which may be repaired through its complementary strand). With both helix strands damaged, the DNA coding information is lost and the damage is beyond repair. Auger therapy aims to make the ""zipper"" get stuck (so to speak), aging the cell instead of killing it. Since the human genome DNA has nine billion base pairs, several breakages anywhere over the molecule could stop the replication process instead of killing the cell. This induced senescence could reduce chemotherapy and radiation doses, reducing side effects, and deliver treatment locally. The aqua-Cl rationale, detaching the chloride ligands from the cisplatin when they enter a cell and binding them to G-G or A-G adducts in the major grooves of the DNA helixes, could be applied to other metals—such as ruthenium (Ru) -chemically similar to platinum. Ruthenium is used to coat the anode target of a mammography X-ray tube, enabling operation at any voltage (22-28kVp) depending on the compressed thickness of the breast and delivering a high-contrast image. Although ruthenium is lighter than platinum, it can be induced to provide a MegaGy Auger dose in situ to the DNA adducts and deliver localized chemotherapy.",Make this easier to understand,wiki

"Social isolation is the complete or near-complete lack of contact with people and society for members of a social species. It is not the same as loneliness rooted in temporary lack of contact with other humans. Social isolation can be an issue for anyone despite their age, though symptoms may differ by age group. Social isolation takes fairly common forms across the spectrum regardless of whether that isolation is self-imposed or is a result of a historical lifelong isolation cycle that has simply never been broken, which also does exist. All types of social isolation can lead to staying home for days or weeks at a time; having no communication with anyone including family or even the most peripheral of acquaintances or friends; and willfully avoiding any contact with other humans when those opportunities do arise. Even when socially isolated people do go out into public and attempt social interactions, the social interactions that succeed — if any — are brief and at least somewhat superficial. The feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem have the potential to produce very severe psychological injuries. True social isolation over years and decades tends to be a chronic condition affecting all aspects of a person's existence. Lack of consistent human contact can also cause conflict with the (peripheral) friends the socially isolated person might occasionally talk to, or might cause interaction problems with family members. It may also give rise to uncomfortable thoughts and behaviours within the person. Social isolation is potentially both a cause and a symptom of emotional or psychological challenges.","Social isolation is the complete or near-complete lack of contact between an individual and society.

"Iceman's appearance while in ice form has changed significantly over the years. In the early X-Men stories, his appearance is more reminiscent of a snowman. The explanation given is that frost formed on his skin when he used his abilities. At the prompting of team leader Cyclops, Drake learns to cover his body with hardened-but-flexible ice and adopts the hard crystalline appearance familiar to modern readers. On several more recent occasions, Iceman has also undergone another transformation due to his defeat in battle, or by extreme circumstances involving heat. While under attack by his fellow comrades Northstar and Aurora-under mind control, Bobby was essentially blown up in his human form. Unbeknownst to him, his body reacted by instantly disintegrating into snow, which in turn melted and he existed in a gaseous state for a short period of time. In an attempt gone wrong by his teammate Mystique to prevent Aurora from killing the others, Iceman was able to stop Aurora by putting her into a cryo sleep while still in his gaseous state. Iceman was then able to reconstitute his solid form by coalescing from steam to ice to flesh.

"Slip controlled drives control the speed of an induction motor by increasing a motor's slip, either by reducing the voltage applied to the motor, or increasing the resistance of the rotor windings. Because they are generally less efficient than other types of drives, slip controlled drives have lost popularity and have recently been used only in special situations. See eddy current drives above. In larger ratings (more than a few kilowatts), a wound-rotor motor has its rotor connected to a converter that returns energy to the power system, converting it from low slip frequency to the line frequency. This reclaims the energy that would otherwise be wasted in rotor circuit resistors. Variable-speed slip energy recovery drives are used in such applications as large pumps and fans, wind turbines, shipboard propulsion systems, large hydro-pumps / generators and utility energy storage flywheels.","A slip-controlled wound-rotor induction motor (WRIM) drive controls speed by varying motor slip via rotor slip rings either by electronically recovering slip power fed back to the stator bus or by varying the resistance of external resistors in the rotor circuit.

"In the West Balkhash region in Kazakhstan, lies the Burubaital Formation that is home to the oldest known abyssal biogenic deposits. This area is composed mostly of chert that was formed over a timespan of 15 million years (late Cambrian-middle Ordovician) .The Burubaital Formation is dated back to before the evolution of diatoms and is dominated by radiolarites; the oldest known organism capable of shell secretion. Because radiolarians tend to accumulate in areas of high productivity and upwelling, it is likely that these deposits were formed in an oceanic upwelling region in subequatorial latitudes. The Burubaital deposits lead researchers to believe that radiolaria played a significant role in the late Cambrian silica cycle. The Furongian, also known as the late Cambrian (497-485.4 m.y.a.), marks a time of transition for marine biodiversity and is the beginning of biogenic accumulation on the seafloor. If there is a sudden cessation of ooze, scientists infer what is known as a “hiatus”. A hiatus can be anything from the closing of a passage, to increased dissolution rates of carbonate or silica, or a sudden change in deep sea circulation. An example of this is the gradual decline in siliceous ooze deposits in the North Atlantic, and the rise of siliceous ooze deposit in the North Pacific approximately 16 million years ago during the middle Miocene.","The Burubatial Formation, located in th West Balkhash region of Kazakhstan, is the oldest known abyssal biogenic deposit.

"The aberration of light (also referred to as astronomical aberration or stellar aberration) is a relativistic phenomenon important in astronomy, which causes an apparent motion of celestial objects dependent on the velocity of the observer. Historically, it motivated development of the theories of heliocentrism, light, luminiferous aether, electromagnetism and Special Relativity. Aberration is due to the finite speed of light relative to the velocity of the observer, and in general causes objects to appear to a moving observer to be displaced towards the direction of the observer's motion, compared to when the observer is stationary.","Historically, it motivated many important developments in the theories of heliocentrism, light, luminiferous aether, electromagnetism and Special Relativity.

"UAT testing is an area of testing which is about verifying if the business processes the client uses are matched well with the application. Often it is not possible or reasonable for an internal tester to write these for the client. It is very difficult to have an unbiased view of the system as an internal tester, so the client should/could be involved with the tester in writing the use cases for UAT testing, but the tests should be performed by the client. It is a good idea to provide generic advice about UAT testing and encourage the customer to read this. It is also prudent to build this into any contracts so, for example, a client cannot say that their business processes have not been met if they haven’t performed UAT and the UAT tests have not been signed off on by the development team. Ideally UAT tests should be written as early as possible to avoid any unexpected requirements. However, bear in mind that this doesn’t always work well with the Agile methodology and YYMMDD.","So, do you know about UAT testing? It's a kind of testing that checks if the business processes used by the client are well matched with the app. Now, it's not always doable or practical for an internal tester to write these use cases for the client.

That's why it's better if the client gets involved with the tester in writing use cases for UAT testing, but the tests should be done by the client. It's also a nice idea to give general advice about UAT testing and ask the customer to read it.

"There are various types of identity which show how a person fits into different situations. A personal identity is developed from our self-concept, how we perceive ourselves. This can be influenced by any number of things; however, it primarily consists of our current self and our idealised self. There is an observable self that is close to our true self, consisting of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours; however, the behaviours do not always align with thoughts and feelings. This is called cognitive dissonance, where our thoughts and actions aren’t in tune—our actions do not represent our feelings or vice versa.

"So you want to work in the fast food industry. There are many different positions and many things to remember. Culver’s will be the example here. There are a few positions in the front of the house. Register, or cashiers, is the crew members who take orders. Runners are crew members who take the orders out to the guests, whether they are dining in, taking the food to go, or have gone through the drive-thru. Drive is the crew members who take orders in the drive-thru over the headset and cash out the guest at the window, and occasionally assist Custard. Custard is pretty self-explanatory. This position is covered by a crew member who is proficient at making concrete mixers, shakes, malts, cones, lemon ice, and dishes. Custard is responsible for drive-thru orders as well as in-house orders. Set is responsible for making sure all of the food is placed correctly on trays or in bags and sent out. They are also the head of the front. Whenever someone needs to do something that will involve being away from their position they must ask the Set person Hospitality, or hospo, is the final position out front. They are responsible for wiping all of the tables and booths/chairs down whenever the guests are finished at them, emptying the garbage, keeping the ice in the soda machine filled, and keeping napkins, ketchup, salt, pepper, wet wipes, mustard, lids, and toothpicks stocked. It is also their responsibility to talk with the guests, make sure they have what they need, take their trays when they’re finished, and occasionally run samples of the Flavor-of-the-Day. Hospo also watches for spills and other messes out in the dining and lobby areas. There is a mop and bucket set as well as a broom and dustpan set. Hospo is also responsible for doing laundry.

Next is Set, okay gang, and Set has to make sure all the food is put on the trays correctly, ok? They also gotta put food in bags, all that stuff, before sending it out. The important thing to remember about Set gang is that they are head of the front. So, if someone has to walk away or get sent to do something else, they gotta clear it with Set.

"Of course, in practice, many governments do not respect indigenous rights and do not give indigenous peoples their rights to the land. In very few countries is there even an infrastructure in place by which to grant indigenous peoples the right to land. In countries where indigenous peoples can own land, the government chooses to “grant” the land to the indigenous population, rather than acknowledging that the indigenous people have an inherent right to that land. Moreover, governments will often not grant indigenous people the rights to the full extent of their traditional lands (indeed, in some respects, the UNDRIP is overly ambitious, because to give back all traditionally owned lands would mean the state is giving up all of its land in many cases). In addition, even where indigenous people have title to some piece of land, that is often not absolute title and is instead just a small part of their traditional lands.","Three ways governments do not respect their indigenous community’s rights to land:

(1) In the few countries that allow indigenous people to own land, the government makes the decision to “grant” it to the native people, instead of admitting that the native people have an intrinsic right to that land.
(2) A lot of the time, governments won’t grand native people the entirety of their traditional lands (though, in some ways, the UNDRIP is trying to accomplish too much at one time, because in many cases, returning all traditionally inhabited lands would mean the state is returning the entirety of its land). 
(3) Even in places where native people have title to a portion of land, a lot of the time that’s not entire ownership and is only a little portion of their traditional land.

This would be the planning phase. Marlin County must determine how much funding they would like to allocate to this communication plan, or public relations campaign.

We must remain professional, but we can make their behavior unwarranted, unbecoming, and something they should be embarrassed to be caught doing.","Communication Strategy Against Littering

Abstract:
 
Following research as to where the problem lies, the individual culprits, and how the public understands it, the next step would involve determining the communications strategy and outline implementation.

Introduction:

This would be the outline phase. Marlin County is required to determine the amount of funds they would like to designate to this plan, or public relations campaign, as funds are needed to reach the public. Though we have the ability to pay for earned media and public relations events, paid media (advertising) is a necessity to connect to large audiences. A multi-layered campaign that is gauged toward multiple demographics is recommended. 

Method:

A portion of the campaign would have educational aspects. The initial step is to educate the public regarding the proper way to transfer their waste to the recycling centers without letting any spill onto the street. It is recommended that these individuals be educated on the proper way to secure their loads in the rear of their trucks or tow-behind trailers. The next step would be to educate people on the ease in taking care of waste built up while driving, without ejecting it through the window. We can assist these individuals to understand that they can obtain free portable trash bags for keeping waste in their cars. They have the ability to dispose of their drink receptacles, candy wrappers, used diapers, and other little items into the bags rather than out the window. These bags will be given out for free courtesy of the local county government. Lastly, we need to start a conversation with the individuals who are completely apathetic toward the situation, and still eject trash out the windows of their vehicles without any empathy for either the environment or the beautification of the region. This conversation will be difficult to start, as they do not care. There will be a lot of challenges in convincing them to alter their actions if there isn’t a hook, or reasons for the issue to matter to them specifically. The most effective thing we are able to do with this group is attempt to make littering look unsanitary, unflattering, and antagonize the individuals who litter on purpose. This must happen without it seeming like we are demonizing the individuals who litter. We have to stay business oriented, though we are able to make their actions uncalled for, unflattering, and an action they should be embarrassed to be caught doing.

"If one wants to write novels for a living, or even non-fiction books for a living, a lot of it comes down to social networking. (Of course, that’s probably true of basically any job.) For non-fiction writers especially, platform-building is crucial if one wants to sell a book, or even land a contract with potential publishers. Non-fiction writers usually have a specific message to get across, and publishers want to know that these writers do have audiences who are listening to them and will take their messages seriously, whether they’re promoting a new cultural movement or coming out with a new devotional. For potential fiction writers, platform-building is less important, but still a good thing to have. At any rate, they’ll need to pursue publishers, and this often comes about through landing good literary agents. It isn’t impossible for people to earn a steady living through writing, but one must have a good strategy to begin with. Unfortunately, English major curricula do not always provide people with these solid strategies, but since many English professors are writers themselves, or at least know writers, even pursuing an English major can help young writers, all through social networking.","If you wanna make a living writing novels, or even non-fiction books, it all boils down to social networking, which, honestly, probably applies to every job.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a figurehead for the Bengali people, leading them into protest and eventually into war with Pakistan. This war became known as the Bangladesh Liberation War. Thousands (possibly millions) of people lost their lives in this war, and it became an incredibly dangerous time for any Bengalis since Punjabi patrols would attack them anytime they were caught in public. India and Great Britain supported the Bengalis in the conflict, and eventually they triumphed over Pakistan, creating the new nation of Bangladesh from the area that had been East Pakistan. It is debated whether or not India and Great Britain gave this support altruistically or out of a Machiavellian kind of “divide and conquer” global political strategy. Bengali culture is centered around art, poetry, and folk music. Most of the country’s population is Muslim, but there are minority groups of Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and Christians living there as well. This is because Bangladesh has a much more tolerant view of minority religions than Pakistan, which is far more strict and conservative. Many Bengalis have migrated away from their birth country, with many deciding to settle in England, particularly in London’s East End. Most of the Bengalis living in this part of London hail from Bangladesh’s rural Sylheti region.

Many writers only write on the side, as they perform some other occupation to put food on the table.","English majors often end up working in vastly different fields from one another. Two of the biggest fields for English majors to focus on are English literature and creative writing. As one can probably guess, English literature concentrations focus more heavily on the reading and analysis of the works of other authors, while creative writing focused students concentrate on producing works of their own. Outsiders may be biased against this field in particular, after all, the value of studying famous works of literature is fairly obvious to society, but creative writing is often seen as more of a hobby than a real career. Obviously creative writing can turn out to be widely successful for a few of its practitioners, such as Stephen King or J.K. Rowling, but is such success really achievable for the vast majority of prospective writers? Perhaps not, as many creative writing teachers and writers themselves will admit that the compensation for such works is often slim. This is why many writers craft their stories on the side, while maintaining a “day job” throughout the week. This can be the secret benefit of being skilled in creative writing, however, since the talents necessary for creative writing can aid one enormously in the completion of other work, while allowing them a creative outlet on the side which could prove enormously fruitful at some point in the future.",Expand on the idea that being a writer is a viable career option,others

"Viscometers allow the measurement of the viscosity of a solution. There are various types of viscometers used in laboratories, but one of the most simple is the Ostwald viscometer. The principle of a viscometer is as follows: the time taken for a sample to flow down a narrow capillary between two marker lines is measured. This time is compared to the time taken for water to flow between the same lines. By dividing these two times, relative viscosity can be determined. A viscometer must use a narrow capillary to ensure that the viscous properties of the fluid are influential on the flow time. A wide capillary would mean that the inertial forces are larger than the viscous forces, making the flow turbulent. More complex viscometers use multiple capillaries and allow for the determination of kinematic viscosity. Viscometers are incredibly important to the chemical industry, in particular with fuels. A fuel’s viscosity must be known precisely at a wide range of temperatures, so that it can be transported and used safely. A large change in viscosity with temperature could lead to unexpected behaviour, for example, in an engine, which could be dangerous.","Viscometers measure how viscous a solution is. There are many different types of viscometers, but the Ostwald viscometer is one of the simplest. Viscometers work by measuring how long a substance takes to flow down a narrow tube compared to how long it takes water to do the same thing. Relative viscosity can then be found by dividing these two numbers. The tube has to be narrow so that the viscousness of the fluid can affect how long it takes to flow. Too wide of a tube would make the flow too unstable for the fluid’s viscousness to affect the flow properly. Some more complex viscometers use multiple tubes for enhanced comparisons that can determine kinematic viscosity. Viscometers are very important to work in chemistry, particularly regarding fuels. It is very important for us to know the viscosity of fuels at different temperatures, so that it can safely be moved and used. A change in viscosity could lead to unexpected engine behaviours, for example, which could be very dangerous!",break into smaller sentences with varying lengths and engaging style,others

"Touching more on the subject of lighting, try to use the same color light.  Lights are rated in color from warm to cool.  Warm lights are yellowish red in tint, and cool lights are white or blue colors. They are rated in degrees Kelvin.  The lower the degree K the warmer the light.  Mixing cool and warm lights might provide some cinematic flavor to a shot or scene, but it should be avoided in an educational setting, as it will provide a distraction to students.  As for fluorescent lights, make sure your camera settings do not produce “flicker” when filming them. If this occurs, try adjusting the FPS and the exposure settings.  Make sure you test these settings before you go live!  Another thing to watch out for is lines moving down the screen, this is caused by lights putting out light in a frequency that conflicts with the camera settings.

"The next step to remember is that when you hear a siren, you must press the response buttons. There are two buttons: one on the front and one on the back. They must be pressed and released at the same time to be effective. The patient has approximately forty-five seconds to do so before treatment is administered. A siren indicates that an undesirable rhythm has been identified by the system that would warrant a treatment or shock to correct the arrhythmia. However, if an arrhythmia occurs, more than 95% of people become unconscious due to inadequate blood flow to the brain. If you are awake and alert, it is unlikely that an arrhythmia is occurring. Pushing the response buttons simultaneously will delay treatment. Some people get confused and wonder why they would delay a treatment if the monitor seems to indicate that something is wrong. It’s important for people to remember that there are other things that would cause the monitor’s alarm to go off besides a fatal arrhythmia, including loose electrodes that are not making good contact with the skin. In these instances, treatment is not required. Always remember, if you hear a siren, press the response buttons.

"I have learned through different seminars and workshops that when trying to convince someone of something, facts and statistics actually don’t work. This idea confuses many scientists, because their lives are so data-driven and based on evidence that it’s hard for them to empathize with those people they are trying to convince. Instead, the focus should be on empathy and finding mutual values and morals; this is the way to gain trust with someone. From there, you will be able to work with them to educate and persuade them toward your belief system. Again, this method is one that is unfamiliar to scientists, but instead of focusing on yourself as a scientist, think of yourself as a person first. What do you care about? For most people, it is making the best food choices for ourselves and our families. That is something we can all agree on. Approaching the situation being prepared to discuss why you are comfortable purchasing and consuming genetically engineered food products is a better way to bridge the gap between different groups. We all have to eat food; the differences lie in how it is produced, and what we understand about those methods.","Several different seminars and workshops have taught me that facts and statistics are not the best way of trying to convince people to change their minds. Many scientists and other data-minded people struggle with this concept since they so often equate statistics to evidence, and evidence to truth. While there is some accuracy to that belief, it makes it difficult to empathize with people outside that mindset. So, instead of focusing on facts and statistics, the first step towards changing someone’s mind should instead be to empathize with them and find some common ground. Only after that common ground has been found can you begin to try to educate and persuade people. It is far more important to think like a person than like a scientist. When discussing genetically  engineered food, for instance, the best course of action would be to establish common ground centered on everyone’s shared desire to buy and consume nutritious, high quality food. Only after that mutual understanding has been found can you begin to explain the facts and figures surrounding genetically modified foods. To reiterate, whenever you want to change someone’s mind, step one is to establish common ground, and only after that is accomplished can you begin step two, which is to actually attempt to change their mind through evidence.",make sure the instructions are clear and easy to follow,others

One of the more rewarding aspects of the job is students learn in fun, encouraging, and playful environment as you build a one-on-one relationship with them. Teaching a child one-on-one can provide several benefits. It allows for individualized attention, meaning that you can tailor the lesson to the child's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses. One-on-one instruction allows for a customized pace of learning. You can adjust the lesson speed based on the child's progress and abilities, leading to better retention of the material and increased motivation to learn. When a child receives personal instruction, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn. This can result in better academic performance and increased esteem for you and your student. Also, if you prefer to teach in small groups, that is a possibility. You can also teach in large groups if you would like a challenge.

"LifeVests, made by ZOLL, are a type of external defibrillator worn to protect against the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. People who have a low ejection fraction, or decreased heart function, are at risk for arrhythmias that can cause sudden death. While a defibrillator is the most common way to protect yourself if this happens, most people do not have one around or available when they experience an arrhythmia. Also, not everyone would require a permanently implanted defibrillator, as the heart can strengthen with certain medications. Therefore, ZOLL makes an external defibrillator called a LifeVest. The garment is secured with a belt that has defibrillator pads and built-in gel. A monitor is worn around the waist. This monitor allows an individual to interact with the system in case changes need to be made. These changes typically involve the electrodes on the belt.","“LifeVest” brand external defibrillators are produced by the biomedical company “ZOLL”. They are a form of external defibrillator worn by users to lessen the risk of a sudden cardiac arrest. Individuals with poor heart health, including low ejection fractions, dangerous arrhythmias, or simply decreased heart function can find themselves in sudden need of a defibrillator at any moment. Unfortunately, defibrillators, while useful, are not always commonly found, and those who need them do not often have much time for one to be found and utilized effectively. For some people, a permanently implanted defibrillator, such as a pacemaker, may be the best option, though such devices are not universally applicable or completely necessary since heart function can be improved in a variety of ways including through medication. This is the reason why ZOLL created the LifeVest external defibrillator. The device has built in defibrillator pads contained in specially designed gel and is secured with a belt. A monitor is worn around the waist which allows the user to interact with the device should any changes become necessary. Necessary adjustments usually involve the electrodes attached to the belt.",add more technical details,others

"The first step is to check for orders of the day. Samples are submitted into the receipt fridge for collection. Check that the customer has filled out the receipt form and cross-check this with the samples in the fridge. Next, we submit the samples to our LIMS system (Laboratory Information Management System). Here we check the samples against the order.

For scientists who have spent their careers studying and developing technology, it can become challenging to see the drawbacks and consider the viewpoint of someone who may not trust new technologies.

"Today we are going to talk about the music industry. Over the years, the music industry has changed drastically. Going from record and CD stores to everything being completely digital has opened up new doors to many different opportunities, but also shut doors for many companies. In the early 2000s, there were CD stores, record stores, and video stores littering every strip and plaza across the US. Slowly, those stores began to diminish due to digital stores and sites such as Limewire, iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, and now YouTube Music. To say that the digital age has had an effect on this would be an understatement. Children who were born in the late ‘90s and early 2000s spearheaded this digital advancement. Not only were music stores affected, but video stores were affected as well. How long has it been since we’ve even heard about Blockbuster? Netflix has also gone completely digital now. In the past, they used to send out DVDs monthly to their subscribers. This all has to do with ease of access. Not only as Americans, but as humans, we like to find an easy way out of situations and we love when things are available right then and there at our fingertips. It allows us to save our time and spend it on something more important. Being able to unlock your mobile device and/or sign onto your laptop and have the world literally at your fingertips allows for less time to be spent getting in your car and driving to the store to purchase what you were looking for. This, however, was very bad for physical stores. A huge financial decline ensued, as more and more people began to convert to the digital stores. Imagine this: You spend so much money on renting or leasing a business, then to acquire the product, and also to publicize your business for several years, just for some digital store to take all of your customers. Something that you’ve worked on for a very long time has been uprooted by a program that was just created in the span of a year. Financially, you’re struggling, so you have to eventually close down your shop and find something else to bring in the big bucks. Although there are still a few physical shops out there, they are mainly for older generations who still own the devices to play back the material. Most youth from this generation wouldn’t even know how a Walkman worked, even if the instructions were right next to them. At the rate that physical stores were going out of style, so were the playback devices. From Walkmans to CD players, MP3 players, and handheld radio devices, they are rarely seen today. You can now access the material you want to listen to or watch and the playback device within one console: a laptop, tablet, iPad, or other mobile device. This saves us, the consumers, money as well. Instead of having to spend money on the material and the device, we make a one-time payment on the device and several small payments on the material. Unfortunately, this has made us lazier. Movie nights, binge watching, and TV series have allowed for us to be more stagnant in the work that we do everyday if we let them. We have to motivate ourselves to get physical throughout the day when everything is, again, at our fingertips. Most physical store owners were not left behind. After realizing that those stores were no longer a necessity, they began investing in their own competition. This allowed them to reap the benefits of what the competitor is making and receiving.","Today we will discuss the music industry.

"A main pro of using a swing in a NICU environment is that it calms the infant during bouts of sleeplessness. We need our infants to sleep carefully controlled, meaning that we want to know the number of hours they are sleeping, so as to make sure their play time, held time, etc. is monitored. An infant needs to sleep to grow and thrive. They do not eat well when they aren’t sleeping. They are unable to digest properly, and occasionally they have difficulty maintaining their temperatures if they are not getting enough rest time. In particular, a NAS baby has more difficulty with regulating their stimulation, meaning that their tremors and shaking can decrease their ability to soothe enough to sleep. They need the continuous motion of a swing, and often the sound that comes with most swings, in order to relax into the mood necessary for sleeping. Most swings also allow for an infant to be swaddled in a swing, and this provides two barriers rather than just the one barrier of a blanket, to entice the infant into a more restful sleep position.","The main benefit of utilizing a swing in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is that it has a calming effect on the infant during periods of sleeplessness. We need their sleep to be diligently monitored, which means we need to know the number of hours they sleep in order to ensure their play time, held time, etcetera, is regulated. Sleep is essential for the growth and development of infants. Inadequate sleep can negatively impact an infant's ability to eat, digest properly, and regulate body temperature. Specifically, a neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) baby has more difficulty regulating their stimulation levels, resulting in tremors and shaking, which can hinder their ability to self-soothe and fall asleep. They require the constant movement of a swing and its sound to relax into a mood conducive to sleeping. Additionally, most swings allow for swaddling an infant, providing two barriers instead of one in the form of a blanket to promote a more restful sleep position for the infant.",write in style of a professional academic paper,others

"An identity is the beliefs, qualities, values and personality of a person, combined to create an overall view of who that person is. People use identity as a means of expression, and as a way to differentiate themselves from others. There are many ways that people can use identity to represent themselves, using physical and social cues as “shortcuts” when expressing their own identity, and looking for others that share similar values and beliefs. For example, how one dresses can represent whether they are meticulous or slobby, rich or poor, outgoing or introverted.","The foundation of identity is constructed through beliefs, qualities, values, and personality. These factors unify to create a comprehensive understanding of who that person is. Identity is used to channel expression and individualization. There are numerous avenues in which identity can be used to symbolize who we are. This can be done through physical and social indicators as ""shortcuts"" when conveying one's identity and searching for others who maintain similar beliefs and values. For example, a person's attire indicates whether they are meticulous, slobby, financially well off or struggling, expressive or shy. Another example is how one verbally communicates.

That might have been the case in years past, but not so much anymore. People are graduating with doctorates and not finding jobs in their intended fields, even if they went into law or medicine for the express purpose of securing a steady job that makes six figures. Some argue that it’s time to revisit the career of the novelist and look upon it with considerably more respect than we used to give it.

This is the case even for people who chose those career paths solely for the high likelihood of securing steady, well-paying employment.

"DNA quantification is set up on the liquid handling robot and read on a fluorometer.  First make sure you have appropriate standards for the assay. These should be aliquoted out and placed in the fridge. We use the 0-100ng standards to ensure all sample concentration ranges are covered. Take out the standards and shake them on a plate shaker while allowing to come to room temperature. Whilst the standards are shaking, prepare the assay buffer. This is made up in a 1:200 ratio of dye to buffer. Add an extra couple of samples to your calculation for pipetting error. Make up this working buffer solution in a reservoir container.  Next get your samples that you want to quantify ready. Make sure they are shaken on the plate shaker or vortexed. Quickly spin down using a centrifuge for thirty seconds.

Reading quizzes should be relatively easy and students should be able to get more points if they have read the material, but they should not require extensive study. Third, students come to class. Because they have already done preparatory work outside of class, you do not need to lecture to them and repeat what they have learned. Hooray!  No lecturing!  What do you do instead? Good question. Class time can be spent on problem sets, tough questions, designing experiments, anything that will help the students work on the harder conceptual problems in the subject matter. I use exam questions from prior years. First, have the students tackle the problem on their own. Next, have them compare their answers to other students (peers). Finally, you can discuss  what the ideas were as a class. This is classic “think, pair, share.” Almost any type of question can be used to start working together on the difficult aspects of the material. Of course, you will still lecture sometimes. Try to keep it to a minimum, though.  Think of them as mini-lectures.  But there is a saying:  “whoever is doing the teaching is doing the learning.” So try not to teach, but to guide the students and enable them to teach each other.","Utilize the learning cycle to steer students within each lesson. Initially, students should read background material using guided reaching questions. After this, administer an online reading. This should be done before class to serve as an indicator of the student’s reading comprehension. Students should be equipped to easily navigate the quizzes and receive additional points if they have read the material, but extensive study should not be necessary. Third, students need to attend class. Due to them completing preparatory work on their own time, you are not required to lecture them over material they are already familiar with. Rejoice! No lectures! You may be wondering what you should do instead. Time spent in class can be focused on problem sets, challenging questions, creative experiments, and anything that will aid the students in making better progress on the subject’s more challenging conceptual problems. I refer to exam questions from prior years. First, instruct students to work on problems by themselves. Next, ask them to contrast their answers with their peers. Finally, discuss the ideas as a class. This is classic “think, pair, share.” Nearly any question type can be used to begin working together on the material’s challenging aspects. Some lecturing will still be required, though it should be kept to a minimum. Consider them as mini-lectures.

"Another aspect of communication I have been taught is to not reach past your area of expertise. You may be talking about genetic engineering in food production, and someone asks about the economic impacts of the different systems (organic vs conventional). If you don’t understand or study economics, don’t make a potentially false claim that the one system is more efficient or affordable than the other; state that you don’t know that answer, but you’d be happy to put them in touch with someone who does. That way, the person retains the trust of those who they’re speaking to, and you don’t accidentally spread false information on an already controversial subject.","Another crucial part of effective communication is avoiding reaching beyond the limits of your own expertise in conversation. Conversations can often drift from topic to topic, say from the specifics of genetic engineering in food production to the economic effects of different food growing systems. In this example, a highly effective communicator, you wouldn’t make claims about those economic effects unless they’d studied or have a strong understanding of economics. An effective communicator would instead admit that they don’t know the answer to such a question, but that they can look into it, or find someone who does have the expertise to answer it. This technique will help you maintain the trust of your audience, and protects you from accidentally spreading misinformation about a potentially controversial topic.

I’ve found that through training and consistent refresher courses,  managers and supervisors are your best line of defense when it comes to ensuring that everything runs smoothly. You need to start at the top and train the people who are responsible for scheduling and ensuring that everyone takes their breaks and lunches on time. Once you train your managers and supervisors, you can then hold them responsible for their actions, or lack of action, when it comes to ensuring that their employees are on time and receiving the breaks and lunches that they should.

If you love food and have a high expectation, the food that you serve your customer should always be of high quality, as that’s what you would want if you were the customer. You also want to learn about the foods more. You want to know what ingredients are in it, how to make it at home, etc. This helps a lot when customers ask you to explain a dish. If you know which ingredients are in it, you can explain it a lot better. You should also always taste the dishes yourself. This is more a tip for managers and bosses. Having your staff taste the food you sell is incredibly good for business, as after all it is your staff that sell the items, not you.

I once was reviewing a video which shot before my tenure in the distance education program) where the video was swaying oddly.  I almost got seasick watching it.  The teacher was wearing a wired lapel mic and was shifting his weight and swaying a little.  The wire from his mic had been caught on a chair and lost all its slack.  Every little move from the professor was transferred to the camera.  Keep this in mind as you run wires for mics.

The wire, meanwhile, had become wrapped up in a chair and so had no excess slack to handle his movements, thus every little movement from the professor was translated to the camera. IT is important to keep such possibilities in mind when setting up wired mics.

"Lastly, communication is a very necessary skill to learn when working in a kitchen. Even front of house workers in a restaurant must learn how to communicate amongst both kitchen and restaurant staff. The first reason communication is necessary is to avoid many potential dangers when working in a kitchen. Often times, somebody preparing food will need to transport something sharp or hot to the dish area, such as a chef’s knife or a hot cast iron pan. When maneuvering through the kitchen with objects like these, a competent cook would communicate to his coworkers that he is carrying said objects. For instance, in most kitchens, if you are walking around with a knife, especially around corners, you should call out, “knife!” very clearly and loudly. This signals to those around you that you have a knife in your hand and to be mindful when moving around to avoid getting cut accidentally. The same technique is used to communicate when carrying a hot pot or pan, yelling, “hot pot!” while maneuvering throughout the kitchen. This level of communication prevents injury on the job. However, there are many other needs and uses for communication in the kitchen.","Finally, good communication skills are vital to have when working in a kitchen. It is important even for the front of house restaurant staff to be able to effectively communicate with kitchen and restaurant staff both. The primary reason this is so important is because kitchens can be quite hazardous places. In addition to the many stationary hazards that must be navigated, such as hot stoves and wet floors, it is not uncommon for someone to be carrying dangerous items such as sharp knives, hot cooking implements, or even flaming entrees from place to place in a kitchen. It is crucial for the individuals handling such potentially dangerous items to effectively communicate with everyone around them. For instance, it is expected for staff to loudly and clearly call out “knife!” when carrying a knife, particularly around corners or other areas of poor visibility. This is a warning to those around you to be careful in their movements, since you are handling a potentially dangerous implement. The same technique is utilized when moving hot pots, pans, bowls, plates, or trays from place to place within the kitchen. This high level of communication is very important for preventing workplace injuries, though there are many other reasons why communication is key in the kitchen, including for teamwork and morale purposes.",add more examples to support the argument,others
"Now I am running out of stream-of-consciousness things to say about QA, testing processes, usability testing, performance testing, beta testing, and translations. Security tests are often a point of contention. The developers often want to push back against security tests. I think this is because they know that the frameworks they use to build applications  are inherently insecure, and they don’t have the tools to improve them. Knowing the underlying architecture and only using approved frameworks provides a feeling that their creative abilities are being stifled. Very few development teams have a strict adherence to only using tools from the approved set of tools, so the security tests work to find the flaws, and the entire architecture of the application might have to be rethought as a result. Having an architecture team that complies with the security guidelines is often useful, but a development team that tries to make an end run around the architecture team will often recreate security flaws.
","Currently, my mind is having a hard time recalling advice about QA, testing processes, utilization experimentation, performance experimentation, beta experimentation, and translations. It is not rare that security experiments become a point of contention, as the developers tend to push them back. I am of the mind that this is due to them being aware that the frameworks they utilize to construct applications are intrinsically insecure, and they have not acquired the tools to improve them. Being aware of the inner architecture and only utilizing endorsed frameworks gives off the notion that their creative capabilities are being mitigated. Not many development teams require them to only use tools from the endorsed set. So the security tests are meant to find the errors, and the whole architecture of the application may need to be redesigned because of it. Obtaining an architecture team that follows the security guidelines is useful a lot of the time, but a development team that attempts to create an end run around the architecture team will most of the time recreate security errors.",make sure the text is clear and easy to understand,others

English degrees do not ready students to become English teachers or anything so standard. Instead, it ensures that students hone their literary talents to apply to many areas of life. For example, writing prowess is needed in business, public service, education, technology, and law. Combining an education in English with a pointed passion for a specific field gives English majors an advantage in the job market upon graduation.",add more details about how to find a job,others
"Always leave some time in your schedule for interruptions. We will all have them, even with the best laid plans. At home, the baby wakes up from her nap unexpectedly. You have a child who is sick at school and needs to be picked up. At the office, the client hates the proposal that they loved yesterday, so you have to rework it by the end of the day. You have the opportunity to pitch a client for their account, and they want to hear it in a couple of hours. Or an interruption can be something as simple as a birthday party for a colleague, or an invitation to lunch with your superior. No matter what the situation, the point is that interruptions happen. So have a schedule that is well put together, but can still withstand the flexibility necessary to deal with life situations.","It will likely be wise for you to leave some room in your schedule for interruptions to occur. After all, they happen constantly and are notoriously difficult to predict. Perhaps the interruption may be that an infant has awoken from a nap early, or maybe a child needs to be picked up from school early due to illness. Or perhaps the issue is more directly work-related, say a client changes their mind about a project at the last possible minute, or a new opportunity suddenly arises with very little time for preparation. Interruptions can be as simple as an invitation to lunch with a supervisor, or even to a coworker’s birthday party. Interruptions can come from anywhere at any time so it would be highly advisable to create a schedule that is flexible enough to withstand such unexpected circumstances.",make it more polite,others
"Employees typically fall into two categories, sellers and merch. Sellers are constantly on the floor approaching customer and asking them what they need. They float around looking for “targets.” It sounds harsh, but they have to make a certain amount of money per hour. They typically get the most dressed up and have a huge client base. They are never still. They are always running around, trying to find new clients, and they are good at what they do. It is amazing to see them in action. On the other side of the equation is “merch,” short for merchandise. These are the people who directly handle the merchandise. They restock shelves, fix bra displays, and also sell merchandise to customers. They do a bit of everything in the store. Working with merchandise can get overwhelming, because you are expected to do so much, while still making sure that your table is in order. It really is the best job for multi-taskers. Both categories can be exhausting, but fulfilling. If you are more outgoing and goal-oriented, you should sell on the floor. If you are more into organization and selling on your own terms then choose merch. Each job comes with its own set of challenges, but they are both rewarding","Employees pretty much fall under two branches, sellers and merch. Sellers are always walking around the establishment, coming up to consumers and inquiring as to what they would like to purchase, if they are looking for something specific, or just browsing. They travel around searching for “targets,” or people that look ready to buy something. It sounds harsh, but they need to generate a certain amount of income every hour. They usually dressed the nicest and have a very large clientele. They are always moving, attempting to find new clients. They are good at what they do, with prior practice to hone their expertise. It is incredible to witness them do what they do. On the other side of the process is “merch,” short for merchandise. These are the individuals who directly deal with the products. They restock shelves, repair bra displays and also vend merchandise to consumers (though not as much as the sellers, of course). They are a jack of all trades in the store. Working with merchandise can become a lot at once, because of the amount of different responsibilities, while still making certain that your table is arranged correctly. It really is meant for multi-taskers. Both branches can take a mental toll, but are fulfilling. If you are more of an extrovert and goal-oriented, you may be best selling on the floor.

Yet this is not just passive reading, for just as there is such a thing as good and poor writing, there is also good and poor reading skills. Poor reading skills entail glancing over words on a page and only partially taking in its meaning.

"For this document, I am going to explain how to complete all of the daily tasks for my job as a digital producer for a publishing-related magazine and website. These instructions should allow someone to fill in for me, and do my job when I am out of the office. Twice weekly, it is my job to compile and publish a newsletter that is then sent to around 30,000 opt-in subscribers. “Opt in” means that all of our subscribers manually signed up for the newsletter through our website, and they are not being sent any content they didn’t subscribe to. One of the first things I do when I come in is to look through my email and Dropbox and see who has sent me articles and images. Each week, the newsletter contains some custom or new content, as well as content from the website and digitized versions of the print articles. Often the print articles need to be digitized by me. This is usually the easiest task to accomplish because the articles are already proofed and have already been published. So I don’t need to wait for anyone to respond to me or to get me assets. Each week, you can access the newsletter outline in our shared drive on the company network. It will tell you what articles are going into the newsletter, as well as which authors are being featured in the section which highlights book deals from that week. It also contains some information about the advertisements and various articles which will be linked on the side of the newsletter but not featured. These are typically older articles that were popular, or some recurring features like reviews of the week, and the bestseller lists. After you have gone through your email and Dropbox, and you have downloaded any content that you received from the editors, you should save all of the assets in individual folders inside the newsletter folder on the shared drive. It is important to never modify the original file in case we need it in the future. To that end, I find it is best to create a subfolder in each article folder called “originals”. This is where I store all the original files. Once articles have been approved, you can begin adding them to the newsletter template in the CMS. There are links to the CMS pages on your desktop. Once you get into the CMS you can create a new article by pushing the New Article button. Each article needs to have four headlines. The headlines are for web, print, newsletter, and subscription. They are usually all the same headline, but the article won’t publish correctly without all four filled in. It is also important to choose a category for the article. Since the newsletter is children’s-themed, you always want to choose the options under “children’s”. If it is an interview or profile, you should choose the option “Author”. If it is related to bookselling news you should choose that category. Bookselling news is anything like a trade fair, book fair, author convention, events and so forth. This category also includes anything that is related to a book deal. So this will include the book deals article. The “Books” category is pretty self-explanatory, this refers to any article of book round-ups, reviews, and the like. It’s usually pretty easy to tell if something is book news or author news, but if you feel confused you can ask someone. We also have the category “Common Core”. This comes up pretty rarely but is, as the name suggests, about the Common Core. After you choose the category, you can copy and paste the article into the article content box. Often, formatting doesn’t carry over properly so it is important to check and make sure all the italics and things copy over. It is also important to check any hyperlinks that might be in the story. Next, you need to create a blurb for the story. This is usually the first few sentences of the article, but sometimes if the article is less ‘newsy’ it is just a summary of the articles contents. For instance, you don’t want to lead off a profile with a quote as the blurb, even though a quote is often the first thing in the blurb. When formatting interviews, it is important to put the questions that the interviewer asks in bold/blue and the intro above the interview in italics. After that, you can save the article and hit “Preview.” Make sure everything looks good then go back into the article page on the CMS and add any photos. To add photos, scroll down and click “Add Media”. The photos shouldn’t be any wider than 600 pixels. The photo in the first position is always the photo that shows up on the preview. To actually make the images appear in the article, you add the tag [photo NAMEOFPHOTO width=”600”]. You can make the width smaller if you don’t want it to stretch the entire width of the article page. You can also add captions below the image. Again check the preview link. If it looks good, you can then go to the newsletter CMS page and add the article. You should also add a small preview image. We crop preview images in a 5x4 ratio for consistency. Once all of the articles have been proofread and added, and once they are in the template, you should check the newsletter preview. Make sure the blurbs make sense and that they haven’t been cut off. Make sure the images are clear and not pixelated, and that they are consistently sized. It is also crucial to make sure that none of the advertisements conflict with the stories. The marketing team will add the ads in (but make sure they work) yet it is important that we aren’t running an article about a new book that is being advertised in the issue. It looks like a conflict of interest. If there is an ad for something we have an article about, we can always just hold the article until next week. Once you have everything proofed, send the link to the children’s editor and she will check it out. If there any changes are  needed, she will let you know. Once any final changes have been made, you can send the CMS link to the digital team and they will send it out. Always try to send out the newsletter by 5:00 PM EST.","For this document, I’m explaining how to complete my daily tasks as a digital producer for a publishing-related magazine and website.

"Touching more on the subject of lighting, try to use the same color light.  Lights are rated in color from warm to cool.  Warm lights are yellowish red in tint, and cool lights are white or blue colors. They are rated in degrees Kelvin.  The lower the degree K the warmer the light.  Mixing cool and warm lights might provide some cinematic flavor to a shot or scene, but it should be avoided in an educational setting, as it will provide a distraction to students.  As for fluorescent lights, make sure your camera settings do not produce “flicker” when filming them. If this occurs, try adjusting the FPS and the exposure settings.  Make sure you test these settings before you go live!  Another thing to watch out for is lines moving down the screen, this is caused by lights putting out light in a frequency that conflicts with the camera settings.  Some modern cameras have settings to compensate for this.","On the subject of lighting, use the same color light. Light are rated in color from warm to cool.

"Viscometers allow the measurement of the viscosity of a solution. There are various types of viscometers used in laboratories, but one of the most simple is the Ostwald viscometer. The principle of a viscometer is as follows: the time taken for a sample to flow down a narrow capillary between two marker lines is measured. This time is compared to the time taken for water to flow between the same lines. By dividing these two times, relative viscosity can be determined. A viscometer must use a narrow capillary to ensure that the viscous properties of the fluid are influential on the flow time. A wide capillary would mean that the inertial forces are larger than the viscous forces, making the flow turbulent. More complex viscometers use multiple capillaries and allow for the determination of kinematic viscosity. Viscometers are incredibly important to the chemical industry, in particular with fuels. A fuel’s viscosity must be known precisely at a wide range of temperatures, so that it can be transported and used safely. A large change in viscosity with temperature could lead to unexpected behaviour, for example, in an engine, which could be dangerous.","Viscometers allow the measurement of the viscosity of a solution.

"This essay is about the profound relationship of male sexuality to female sexuality and its socially individual variables, which have to be considered in terms of any social interaction. You as my potential customer will receive a quick and informative overview over the gender dynamics of male and female beings, so you’re going to be able to consider the most important factors of this dynamic within the context of your future social interactions with the opposite gender. Starting out with the harsh reality of both genders not being aware of each other’s desires , today’s men and women are facing a serious problem of ineffective intergender communication. This lack of quality communication between the sexes leads to a broad variety of societal challenges when it comes to successful attraction and retainment of a desired mate for copulation, as well as the continued nurturingof family bonds. Societal and scientific institutions haven’t been able to figure out the underlying dynamics of intergender behavior and communication, and they are additionally struggling to communicate the discoveries that have been made so far to the public. Generally speaking, intergender behavior (better known as dating/mating dynamics) are based on profound evolutionary principles going back millions of years to our very early ancestors. One example of those underlying principles is women’s desire for a “real man” or “alpha male”, who can be recognized through certain intrinsic characteristics, as well as specific external achievements and accomplishments. In public, common belief states that most women desire a rich, good-looking man for the sole purpose of accessing his materialistic gains. This may be partly true, since material abundance usually leads to a more secure, more comfortable existence through abundance of time, choices and higher quality resources. Contrary to this belief are examples of men, who indeed are in ownership of the same intrinsic characteristics like self-discipline, emotional self-control, work ethic, industriousness, etc., but who do not have accomplished or acquired a similar financial or materialistic status yet. These men are still desired by the majority of women despite their lack (or willfully chosen absence) of financial and materialistic success. These exceptions do highlight the theory of women being attracted to so-called alpha males, even if they don’t display the full range of characteristics internally as well as externally. Only a subset of alpha traits seems to be sufficient for the successful attraction of a mate for future copulation. A reason for this might be either expected external success in the future due to existing intrinsic characteristics, or the sheer presence of intrinsic characteristics as being good enough to make the female feel secure and protected enough to engage in copulation. In both cases, this result would serve as evidence against the popular belief that only good-looking, successful, and rich males receive all the attraction from the female population. This would also indicate that men not being part of a rich and successful family, nor being genetically gifted with good looks right after birth would be able to increase the attraction received by females through learning and adapting to the mentioned alpha characteristics. Conscious display of these characteristics would then eventually lead to more successful interactions with female mating partners, as well as more efficient intergender communication through understanding these attraction principles with the opposite gender. Without understanding these principles, both genders (but primarily men) increasingly face a more challenging world in terms of accomplishing sexual interactions, dating frequency and quality as well as long-term family bonds. After having studied and experimented with these principles for years, you as my potential customer will be guaranteed the proper access (and therefore understanding) of the most important and vital mating principles. The correct understanding of these will help you to dramatically increase your personal future prospects in the short- and long-term mating and dating market. No matter if male or female – the correct interpretation of the behavioural nuances of the opposite sex is vital to access an actionable system for the improvement of your own personal behavioural aspects and subtleties. Not only will you learn how to adapt an attractive appearance through proper style, clothing and expression in terms of body language, articulation, and expression. In addition, very complex concepts like internal belief systems, conscious choice of self-talk and the reading of other people’s psychology will be taught in a quickly adaptable way for you to implement right on the spot. Therefore, immediate short-term as well as long-term success with the opposite sex and in terms of intergender communication and interaction can be guaranteed by me personally. Also beneficial for other aspects of your private as well as professional life, this broad set of skills is an essential part on the journey to becoming a sophisticated person, including all internal, positive changes as well as external accomplishments like money, high social status, and materiali abundance of choice in quality and quantity terms. Only through the correct interpretation of existing laws and principles will you be able to achieve the life of your dreams. Only through acquiring the essential knowledge  will you be able to improve yourself, but also your current circumstances if you have the desire to do so. Beyond the common belief of proper education within the academic system, I personally believe in lifelong learning. This is a unique opportunity to gain vital knowledge about the real underlying principles of intergender dynamics and all its subtlte nuances, whose neglect can lead to detrimental consequences. In conclusion, learning about the most successful communication and mating strategies of both males and females will help you to improve the areas of your life you wish to increase in quality and also in quantity if necessary. These changes cannot be made through common sense alone, nor through the implementation of knowledge taught within the realm of the academic system of schools, universities and other public institutions. These sources of knowledge have proven their lack of efficiency within their ability of fully discovering all existent principles and are in conclusion not suited as capable of successfully teaching them yet either.","This essay is about the relationship of male sexuality to female sexuality and its variables, which have to be considered in any social interaction.

"Your belief system runs your life. If you are unhappy, it is because your beliefs are causing your unhappiness. If you are happy, it is your beliefs that are causing your happiness. These beliefs are the blueprint to your life. Many new-agers today are touting self-development techniques, but they fail to include beliefs. You attend a seminar and you’re all excited and worked-up, but then you go home and all that juice is gone. Why? Because you still have those same beliefs that got you in that unwanted position in the first place. If you really want to change your life, change your beliefs. Well, you might say, “I believe that I should be promoted, but I’m not”. Well, I say you don’t believe that you should be promoted or you would be promoted already. I tell you that your beliefs are right in front of your face, you just have to clear your mind and read your thoughts, and you will change your life. You have taken on so many beliefs throughout your life from many different sources: your parents, your friends, your teachers, the media, etc. All of which are in your subconscious mind. These beliefs are unknown to you because you don’t see outside of yourself most of the time. These beliefs are second nature, and it is difficult for most people to be self-aware if they haven’t done the work. So, I recommend that think about what you want, and ask yourself, “what have I been told about myself and about what I want that would stop me from getting what I want?” Let me give you an example, let’s go back to that promotion. You write down what you want and then you start to think about the people that are in the position you want, but don’t have. You realize they have something special that you don’t, and that maybe they have more vocabulary, or they are more stylish, or they have better teeth, and you couldn’t ever possibly see yourself as good as them. Those would be an example of some beliefs that you hold that stand in the way of your dreams. The way to also identify your beliefs is by tracing your feelings. You want to pay attention to the way you feel when someone says something, or when you have a reaction to something or someone, that gives you an insight into yourself. Feelings are often regarded as a weakness in our society, but they serve a very important purpose in our lives. Feelings can be used as indicators, and when you used properly they can help to transform your life. Allow yourself to feel angry or upset and don’t push your feelings down to avoid processing them because they can tell you a lot about yourself. There is this saying that goes like this: “give me a boy until age seven and I will give you a man.” What do you think they mean when they say this? They are saying that the subconscious mind stays open like a sponge and soaks up information, especially anything said with strong feelings and accepts it as truth. The subconscious mind does not judge, so if you were told you are stupid at a young age, then you subconscious mind believes it. The quote is also saying that the maturity of your life is determined by what information is fed to you until age seven. Many people used to believe that a person can’t change, but we know differently now because the brain is capable of changing itself based on how the mind changes. So if you change your ideas or beliefs in your mind, your brain will change along with it. The reason why so many people get stuck is because they are unaware that they are creating their own lives, they think life is happening to them instead of for them. You are the captain of your ship, and until you start changing your beliefs by going inside and changing what you accepted as true, then nothing will change. You can also know this that we so not revisiti the past to judge, but we use it for interpretation and education. We use it to make connections with how we were in the past, and how that has created our present state today. You must also allow yourself to feel your feelings, because if you are out of touch with yourself to the extent that you don’t know how to feel your feelings then a surefire way to get in touch with yourself is to start asking yourself, “why did I do that”, or “why did I get mad at him like that”? Some beliefs may be more difficult to get rid of than others. That is because some beliefs are more deeply-embedded than others. Basically, it means that there are more layers to support that belief, so it is going to be more challenging and it will take more time to heal that belief than it would for a more superficial belief.  The thoughts in your head that cause you distress are indicators of what you believe, but they aren’t the exact beliefs. Beliefs can only clear as they come up, so the best way is to not waste any time and begin removing those beliefs. There are beliefs that were accepted at different levels of brainwave frequencies and they would be best cleared going back to that brainwave frequency. The four brainwave frequencies are: beta, alpha, theta, and delta. Beta is the awake state, alpha is the daydream state, theta is the drowsy state and delta is the sleep state. The less amount of consciousness you have, the closer you are to the subconscious mind so you can understand your beliefs or clear your beliefs. First, you must understand what they are, and then you can clear them. Many of the beliefs you have, you will find have to do with a lack of deserving this can mean a broad basis of beliefs. Self-love has been said to clear out many beliefs without having to know the exact beliefs. There are many routes to the same destination and a few have been presented here. What is important for you to know is that your beliefs are what run your life, and nothing else. Taking quiet time out everyday is a great way to clear out negative beliefs because it gives your body a break from being in a high state of stress all day long, and it allows your immune system to clear out those thoughts that are causing you so much stress. Food therapy is also another way of helping relieve stress. Just as a man becomes what he thinks, in the same way we are what we eat. There are many ways to heal yourself and your life, just choose one and don’t look back! If your choice hasn’t worked the way you like, you can just choose another method.

"The second reason that athletes are not successful at tryouts is because they have not perfected the skills that they do have. Even if a kid has been practicing their new skill all year long and they feel that they are able to perform that skill at tryouts, it is often the skills that they have been doing for years that hold them back. A kid can throw a perfect back handspring at tryouts, but if they have not taken the time to perfect their back walkover or front walkover, we will be less likely to place that kid on a level two team, because we need to see them perfect the skills for level one first.

This also ensures that they will be able to continue to move up in difficulty, because they have mastered the basics. At all levels, it is important to have the skills from previous levels, because they will still be utilized. It is also important to have these skills because it will make it much easier to learn more difficult skills in the future. Everything comes down to body awareness and control.

"Employees typically fall into two categories, sellers and merch. Sellers are constantly on the floor approaching customer and asking them what they need. They float around looking for “targets.” It sounds harsh, but they have to make a certain amount of money per hour. They typically get the most dressed up and have a huge client base. They are never still. They are always running around, trying to find new clients, and they are good at what they do. It is amazing to see them in action. On the other side of the equation is “merch,” short for merchandise. These are the people who directly handle the merchandise. They restock shelves, fix bra displays, and also sell merchandise to customers. They do a bit of everything in the store. Working with merchandise can get overwhelming, because you are expected to do so much, while still making sure that your table is in order. It really is the best job for multi-taskers.

"It is important to choose an appropriate lab for the occasion when setting out to design an inquiry-based unit. Some labs that require specialized equipment that needs detailed instructions in order to understand how it is operated may not be a good choice for this type of activity. An inquiry-based lab is better suited as an exploratory introduction to a chapter, instead of a detailed rigorous data collection study. Inquiry-based labs can be integrated into almost all physics units, even those that intuitively do not make sense at first. For example, when beginning to teach a unit on Newton’s law of universal gravitation, it is difficult to get students to understand a concept that they cannot see. The laws of gravity that hold the universe together are invisible to students, and they cannot begin to comprehend a force of gravity different than that experienced between themselves and their own planet. Trying to go over advanced calculations for other planets can be a boring and unrewarding task for them. However, giving each lab group an open-ended question in the guided-inquiry format can be a very effective means of opening up their minds to this new chapter. NASA and other educational non-profits have online tools that students can explore to simulate gravity on other planets. With a lab notebook in hand, students should be given some online resources and a general question, such as “What color would the sky be on Mars?” or “How would it feel to run and jump on the surfaces of other planets?” Using online computer simulations is an extremely effective way of engaging students in following their own lines of inquiry in a focused way that is also exposing them to the content. Computer-based learning also has the distinct advantage of allowing different groups of learners to discover and learn at various places.","It’s important to pick the right lab when designing an inquiry-based unit.

"DNA quantification is set up on the liquid handling robot and read on a fluorometer.  First make sure you have appropriate standards for the assay. These should be aliquoted out and placed in the fridge. We use the 0-100ng standards to ensure all sample concentration ranges are covered. Take out the standards and shake them on a plate shaker while allowing to come to room temperature. Whilst the standards are shaking, prepare the assay buffer. This is made up in a 1:200 ratio of dye to buffer. Add an extra couple of samples to your calculation for pipetting error. Make up this working buffer solution in a reservoir container.  Next get your samples that you want to quantify ready. Make sure they are shaken on the plate shaker or vortexed. Quickly spin down using a centrifuge for thirty seconds. Once all the reagents and samples are ready, you can set up the robot. Once the software has loaded, you must initialise the system. This is found under the menu ‘instrument’ and then ‘home all axis’. The programs will not run without initialising the robot first. If this is not done an error message will come up when you press ‘start’. Once initialised, select the ‘run’ button from the top toolbar. This will bring up a prompt for you to enter how many columns you are doing. Input the number. Next it will ask you to scan in the barcode of the sample plate and quant plate.

"Today I am going to be talking about how to effectively manage a call center. It is a topic I am very familiar with, and I have a lot of information to share. The first thing that any person looking to manage a call center will need is a lot of patience. Between staff issues, technical problems and customer complaints, there are many points of running a call center that can be stressful. As a manager, you need to be able to keep calm under pressure and also help others cope with any pressures. Staff members will look to you for reassurance and guidance, so you need to always be prepared to help. You also need to have some prior knowledge regarding the equipment you are using, because if something goes wrong, you will need to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Every minute the phones aren’t answered is costing the company money, and possibly causing a customer complaint. You will also need to be an understanding and empathetic person as your staff members will often come to you for help and advice, and you need to be able to help them effectively. As a manager, you will also be required to handle escalated customer complaints and defuse possible tensions. This is where the patience and empathy will come in handy. Customers can often be demanding and impatien. You, as the manager, will need to make the time to listen to their issue and offer an appropriate solution. You will also need to have the ability to not take things personally. Sometimes, customers will vent their frustrations on the first person they see or speak to. As the first point of call for the company, you need to be able to conduct yourself in a professional manner to staff and customers. You need to be able to leave your problems and stresses at home and go to work with a positive attitude. Customers will be able to tell if you are not in a good mood, and they will not appreciate it if you take your feelings out on them. One of the most crucial points is attention to detail. Regardless of the type of company you work for, or what you are selling or offering, attention to detail is imperative. Mistakes cost the company money and that’s not good. Let’s be real, mistakes do happen. Nobody is perfect, but you when you make a mistake, you need to notice it promptly and address the issue. Any issues that may seem small to you may be a big issue to the company or to the customer, so pay close attention. I would advise double-checking all work completed just to avoid any mistakes, even if it takes longer the first time. You are saving time by not having to go back and correct any mistakes. The customer and the company will thank you for your attention to detail. If you are looking to become a call center manager, you will need to be passionate about what you are offering as a business, whether it be stationery or apples. Passion is fundamental. Your passion will reflect in everything you do, and it will rub off on others around you. Having passion in your job is the key to happiness. Not every day will be a great day, but as long as you try, that’s all anyone can do. Solving customer issues can also be rewarding. Customers will go out of their way to thank you for helping them and so will your team! Many people think working in a call center is just picking up a phone, but it is so much more than that. You are the face of the company. You are the person the customer interacts with. You are the person selling the products. Without you, there would be no “us”. I have worked as a call center manager for many years now, and I find it a rewarding role. It’s not without its challenges, but that’s what makes every day different and interesting. You will need to change things up to keep things fresh, otherwise you will lose interest and passion — and by that point maybe even your job. Switch things up by answering with a different greeting, changing around your script (if you use one). Offer different products that you might not have offered before. Just do something different from yesterday and you’ll notice a big difference not only in your mood but also your attention span. Doing the same tasks every day might seem boring, but it’s all about PMA — Positive Mental Attitude. If you tell yourself that you’re unhappy, then you’re unhappy. If you answer the phone with a smile and tell yourself you’re in a good mood, the customer will notice, and it may even help their own mood or attitude! We have all said to ourselves at one point or another “I can’t be bothered”. But we tell ourselves we can’t be bothered, no one else has told us to feel this way. It all comes down to how you want to feel, and if you want to feel in a better mood you truly can do that and it makes all the difference, not just for you and your mental health, but also for your fellow staff members and for your customers. So, as we conclude this task, I just want to say that I hope these tips are useful, and I hope that anyone else working in the same industry can relate to this. Trying to write 1000 words on a topic is daunting to say the least! But once I started, I was really on a roll. It actually made me think of the times that I’ve felt stuck in life, or at a dead end. Just pick yourself up and at least try to start a new day, week or hour. My time has run over, but at least I got to the word count. Thank you for having me on this test. I look forward to the next one.","Today, I am going to be talking about how to manage a call center. It is a topic I am familiar with, and I have a lot of information to share.

They must be pressed and released at the same time to be effective. The patient has approximately forty-five seconds to do so before treatment is administered. A siren indicates that an undesirable rhythm has been identified by the system that would warrant a treatment or shock to correct the arrhythmia. However, if an arrhythmia occurs, more than 95% of people become unconscious due to inadequate blood flow to the brain. If you are awake and alert, it is unlikely that an arrhythmia is occurring. Pushing the response buttons simultaneously will delay treatment. Some people get confused and wonder why they would delay a treatment if the monitor seems to indicate that something is wrong.

"The control of fire was the first great discovery of humankind, because it changed all of their lives.To the early man, fire was a divine gift randomly delivered in the form of lighting  forest fire, or burning lava. Unable to make flames for themselves, the earliest peoples probably stored fire by keeping slow burning logs alight or by carrying charcoal in pots. How  man learnt how to produce flame at will is unknown. It was probably a secondary invention. European peasants would insert a wooden drill in a round hole and rotate it briskly between their palms. This process could be sped up by wrapping a cord around the drill and pulling on each end. The Ancient Greeks used lenses or concave mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays, and burning glasses were also used by Mexican Aztecs and the Chinese. These methods of fire-lighting date back to Paleolithic times, when some Stone Age tool-makers discovered that chipping flints produced sparkes. The technique became more efficient after the discovery of iron, about five thousand years ago. In North America, the Eskimos produced a slow-burning spark by striking quartz against iron pyrites, a compound that contains sulphur. The Chinese lit their fires by striking porcelain with bamboo. Tinder remained the main method of fire-lighting until the middle of the 19th century. Fire lighting was revolutionised by the discovery of phosphorus, isolated in 1669 by a German alchemist trying to transmute silver into gold. Impressed by the element’s combustibility, several 17th century chemists used it to manufacture fire-lighting devices, but the results were dangerously inflammable. With phosphorus costing the equivalent of several  The quest for a practical match really began after 1781 ( I am not sure), when a group of French chemists came up with the Phosphoric Candle or Ethereal Match, a sealed glass tube containing a twist of paper tipped with phosphorus. When the tube was broken, air rushed in, causing the phosphorus to combust. Another device popular in the US was the Instantaneous Light Box — a bottle filled with the sulphuric acid, into which splints treated with chemicals were dipped.The first matches resembling those used today were made in 1827 by Walker.Walker was an English pharmacist who borrowed the formula from a military rocket-maker. Walker never patented his invention, and three years later, it was copied by Samuel Jones, who marketed his product as Lucifers. About the same time, a French chemistry student named Charles Sauria produced the first strike-anywhere match by substituting white phosphorus for the potassium chlorate in the Walker formula. However, since white phosphorus is a deadly poison, from 1845 match-makers exposed to its fumes succumbed to necrosis, a disease that eats away jaw bones. It was not until 1906 that the substance was eventually banned. That was about sixty-two years after a Swedish chemist called Pasch had discovered non-toxic red, or amorphous, phosphorus, a development exploited commercially by Pasch’s compatriot in 1885. This contained potassium chlorate, which has a combustion temperature of 182 degrees centigrade. America lagged behind Europe in match technology and safety standards. It was not until 1900 that the Diamond Match Company bought a fresh patent for safety — but it didn’t work in the different climatic conditions prevailing in the US, and it was another eleven years before scientists finally adapted the French patent for the US. The Americans can claim several firsts in match technology and marketing. In 1892, the Diamond Match Company pioneered book matches. The innovation did not catch on until after 1896, when a brewery had the novel idea of advertising its product in matchbooks.Today, book matches are the most widely used type of match in the US, with ninety percent handed out free by hotels, restaurants, and others.","Mastering fire was the first great achievement of humankind, because it changed everything for early humans. To early man, fire must have seemed to be a gift from the divine, randomly bestowed upon them via acts of nature. Unable to create fire themselves, it is likely that early humans carefully protected and traveled with small batches of slow burning flames. It is not currently known how early humans figured out how to produce flames at will, but it was probably as a result of some other invention. Peasants in Europe created fire by placing a wooden drill into a hole and spinning it between their hands. This technique can be improved by wrapping a length of fiber around the drill and pulling from the ends. The Ancient Greeks created fire by using lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight on a point. Similar fire-starting techniques using glass were also utilized by the Chinese and Mexican Aztecs. Ancient tool-makers were starting fires way back in the Paleolithic Age by chipping pieces of flint to create sparks, a technique that was vastly improved by the addition of iron some five thousand years ago. Similarly, Eskimos in North America created slow-burning sparks by striking quartz on iron pyrites, which contain sulphur. The Chinese also started fires by striking porcelain with bamboo. Tinder was the main method of making fire until the middle of the 19th century, although the practice was revolutionized in 1669 when a German alchemist discovered phosphorus while trying to make gold. Many contemporary chemists used the highly flammable substance to create new fire-starting tools, but the products were far too dangerously good at their jobs. The search for a practical fire-starter kicked off in earnest in 1781, when French chemists created the Phosphoric Candle, a.k.a. the Ethereal Match. This was a piece of paper, tipped with phosphorus, contained in a sealed glass tube which was broken when a user wanted the phosphorus to burn. Another popular choice in the US was the Instantaneous Light Box, a bottle filled with the sulphuric acid, which chemically treated splints were dipped in. An English pharmacist named Walker invented the first modern looking matches in 1827. Walker took his idea from military rocket designs, but never patented the concept. A man named Samuel Jones then copied the idea and marketed the matches as “Lucifers”. At the same time, a French chemistry student created the first match which could be struck anywhere, by substituting white phosphorus for potassium chlorate in the formula. White phosphorus is also a deadly poison though, and many matchmakers ended up dying from jawbone-eating necrosis, leading to white phosphorus being banned in 1906. A Swedish chemist called Pasch discovered red phosphorus in 1885 which is nontoxic and was quickly commercialized. This compound contained potassium chlorate, which burns at 182 degrees centigrade. America lagged behind Europe in terms of match technology and safety. The Diamond Match Company did not even purchase a patent for a safety match until 1900, and even that match failed to work in the many different climates throughout the US. It took eleven more years for the French patent to be adapted for the US. Americans were the first in some matchmaking techniques, however, such as the first book of matches, created in 1892 by the Diamond Match Company. The idea did not catch on until after 1896 though, when a brewery decided to use the book as advertising space. Book matches are now the most common kind of match in the US, 90 percent of which are given away for free by different companies.

"Throughout my experience in the entertainment industry, I have become an expert in costume design for the stage. One of the most important parts of being a costume designer is communication. A designer must effectively communicate with all members of the design team for each production he is a part of, not to mention effective communication with the director of the production. In the past four years, I have  designed costumes for children’s theatre, big-budget theatres, and small professional theaters. One of the most important things to start with when you are designing a play is the script. I find that I must read the script at least three times before I can even start to think about the costumes. The first read is to understand the story. Read the play as if you are an audience member experiencing the play for the first time. I find that not thinking about anything, but plot the first time through helps me to experience a fresh take on the play and identify personal thoughts and feelings that I experience while reading. The second read is to look for deeper meanings. This is when I will start to analyze subtextual meanings, symbolism, and relationships. I am still not thinking about the costumes at this point, only about the greater meaning of the work. The third read is when I will start to think about the challenges a script presents, such as quick changes, double-castings, and other unique scenarios that would present a problem with the design. After this, I am ready to attend the first design meeting with the director and the rest of the design staff. In the first meeting between the designers, director, assistant directors, and stage managers, think about the particular elements you want to bring out within the context of the play. For instance, a director may want to emphasize the relationship between siblings, or the importance of clear communication. The most important thing at this stage is to make sure that whatever you are trying to bring out is in the play. There is nothing worse than a production when the director has forced a concept on a story that it doesn’t belong in. I, personally, have seen many productions in which a director has created a product that could have been great, but is instead tedious, because the entire time I’m thinking about how the concept makes no sense within the story. After the team has discussed the conceptual piece of the play, the concerns with the script must be addressed. It is not important to figure out solutions to these issues at the moment; it is more of a chance to voice them to the room for advice, comments, and brainstorming. After this meeting, a designer is ready to start doing their research. Research comes in all shapes and sizes when it comes to costume design. For some plays, it may mean looking at microfilm in the library to understand a certain historical event. For others, it may mean looking at recent apparel adds to research fashion trends. More often than not, I do my research almost exclusively online, as the internet is an effective platform to share your research with anyone involved, such as the director or an assistant designer. I generally create a folder on a cloud storage platform for each show, and use that folder as a dumping ground for any images I come across that interest me. This way, I have research images for any renderings that I may draft, and I have reminders of my thought processes in case I cannot remember why I thought of a particular solution or piece. It is important to remember throughout all stages of the design that there is no right answer. Though there may be a wrong answer, there isn’t one specific way to do things. After I gather all of my research, I will usually put specific images together in a PowerPoint document with a slide for each character. This will include the character’s general color palette and a sense of the pieces a character would have in their closet. Ideally, after this stage, the designer and the director are on the same page on the ideas being represented by each character. However, if they are not on the same page, it should become apparent by the director's reaction to the research. This is also a good time to catch up on the research of another designer in the room to make sure the production is moving in a cohesive direction. After this, I usually like to read the script again to remind myself of everything I’ve thought about thus far. In this read, I will usually comb through to find any mention of specific pieces in the dialogue. For instance, if the characters are all talking about someone’s red dress, I need to make sure that the character is in a red dress. After this, I will start line drawing. A line drawing indicates the shape of the garments you intend to design without bringing color into the picture. If a designer would like, they can also present a color pallette, but it is not necessary. This way, the director of the production can approve piecesor steer the designer in a new direction with alternative feedback. After this meeting, everyone on the design team ideally knows essentially what the show will look like. This is when a designer can start adding color to the rendering. I usually color my renderings with watercolor, because that is what I was taught in school. At the final meeting, the designers will present final designs and hopefully get approval from the director. If not, there may be an issue with the research or with the interpretation of the play. After this is done, the designer will start to pull pieces from stock, buy new pieces, or build new pieces.","Throughout my experience in entertainment, I have become an expert in costume design.

"I will be discussing the proper way to make Starbucks beverages. Many of the drinks can be prepared very quickly by dispensing them from insulated containers, such as the coffee and  hot water thermals, and the iced coffee and tea dispensers. For many Starbucks customers, their interest tends to venture into more difficult-to-craft drinks. In order to make a latte, you must first steam the milk. This is done by pouring the customer’s choice of milk into a silver, canister-like device, then inserting a heated rod that will blow steam into the milk. Be sure to insert only the tip at first, allowing it to heat only the surface, and then lift the rod out a moment before plunging it all the way in. This will prevent a, frankly, disturbing and loud noise that the machine will make if the rod is inserted directly into cold milk, so it is encouraged that we do it this way to prevent disturbing our customers and ourselves. The thing to do once the milk is settled in and steaming, is to put in the customer’s choice of syrup. A latte does not, by default, come with syrup, and syrup often costs extra, but many people still sweeten them. The correct, default amount of syrup for the sizes are as follows: two pumps in a tall, four pumps in a grande, and five pumps in a venti. If the venti is iced, an additional pump should be added for a total of six, as the iced venti cups are a little bit bigger than the hot cups. Then, it is time to draw the espresso shots from the espresso machine. This is done simply with the click of a button. Talls get one shot. Grandes and ventis get two shots, and iced ventis get three. It is crucial not to let the espresso sit without introducing the milk for any more than ten seconds, as prolonged exposure to the air will sour it and give it a distinctly unpleasant taste. Pour the steamed milk into it slowly, encouraging the non-foamy milk to enter it first, and the foam to rest on top. Some people encourage less-practiced employees to use a spoon in order to hold back the foam initially, then release it at the end. If you steam the milk just right, you will be able to make latte art in it by pouring it in a distinct way. That is how to make a latte. A macchiato is prepared by pouring the shots on top at the end, after the milk and syrup are in the cup. A cappuccino is made by making the milk more steamy by keeping the rod near the top for longer. It contains more foam.","I’ll be discussing the proper way to make Starbucks beverages.

"As an expert in customer service, I have to say that giving the right attitude to customers all the time isn’t easy. But if you just keep wearing that smile and giving them that happy attitude they deserve, then it’ll get a lot easier for you. Whenever I was feeling at the end of my energy, and I really didn’t want to talk to anyone, or I was just simply in a bad mood, I just kept giving customers a smile and respect, and it made me feel better about it all. For me, making somebody feel better makes me feel better. I don’t know if that’s the case for you, but when I followed this mantra of just showing love and giving support to customers, the higher-ups saw me going above and beyond for the company, and they were impressed! They wanted to promote me and make me the face of the company whenever customers came in. I worked at a Wendy’s, and I had only been working there for about three months or so, and they were already going to promote me to crew trainer because I was so good with people. They figured I could train anybody, and I sure did. They always had me working the register so that I could talk to the customers, because if they were having a bad day and being short with the one taking their order, they’d always see me and change that attitude real quickly! They would be so happy to see me, all because I gave them respect and a smile on my face. It made working the job so much easier, not seeing the same lifeless faces come through the drive-thru everyday, but seeing smiles instead, and getting, “Hey! How you been?!” instead of just them handing me my money in silence. If you just give the customer something to work with, they’ll take that positive energy and shoot it right back at you. Of course you have some sticklers and the people who just gave up on human interactions, but you’ve got to lose some to win some, you know? To have this mindset isn’t so hard. You should just think about it from their point of view! Would you rather have somebody whojust doesn’t care at all, with a dead look in their eyes and nothing to say, or what I was talking about: a worker with purpose and something to say everytime you come up to the window, somebody that will engage when you haven’t had much engagement in the day? I’d rather have the second option. Of course, as I said, there are going to be some people who prefer the first option, but hopefully they’ll come around eventually. I remember there was a guy—I promise you his name was Jim Bob. He was always so grumpy—not like meh grumpy, but loud grumpy; let everybody around him know that he’s grumpy kind of grumpy. So one day I asked him, “Hey Jim, how was your day? Anything new happen?” and he said to me that he just got back from the hospital because his mother’s heart was failing, and she’d been dealing with this for a while now. I gave words of encouragement and comfort and a free drink to say, “Hope your day gets better!”. He came in the next day as happy as can be. This man had been grumpy all his life, but he came in with a smile on his face, asking me the same question I asked him the day before. He said his mother was doing better, that the talk we had yesterday really helped him out, and he’s been coming into Wendy’s really happy to see me ever since. It feels good because he was one of worst customers before. We dreaded seeing him come in, but now he’s a good ol’ regular. I only have a couple more stories like that, and they’re from other places where I’ve worked, and honestly, you probably don’t want to hear about them. They’re a little longer than that last one. But nonetheless, it’s a great way of making yourself and others feel happy, and I can’t stress enough how important it is for a business when you give their customers some really good customer service. They’ll always want to come back so that they can be treated nicely, and it gives you a little confidence boost. There’s a saying at one of my older jobs that, “you should leave your troubles at the door when you come into work.” I like that saying a lot because I’m so good at customer service because of it. It made me a better person; made me the man I am today because of that silly saying. I regret working at the job, but I don’t regret what I’ve learned from it. You know what? Have fun with it as well. Try to make some friends, why don’t you? Don’t try to give them your number or be too pushy, but whenever they come to visit, it should feel good to you; give you a little pep boost in the middle of the day. Going to work and seeing somebody you know there just makes it easier, don’t you think? I really do strongly feel that way. Whenever I’m working with my friends, I feel as if the day just goes by a lot faster. But all in all, customer service is more than just chores, an extra standard you have to tack onto the list of standards you already have for the company. It’s a way of life. You become a better speaker outside of work, and you get to talk to some people you may have thought were pretty interesting. Plus you make some new friends, which is always a nice bonus. But don’t forget, it also helps you out with the higher-ups! Getting promotions and good things like that is easy if you show you care about the company.","Giving the right attitude to customers all the time isn’t easy. But if you keep smiling and giving them the attitude they deserve, then it’ll get easier. Whenever I was at the end of my energy, and didn’t want to talk to anyone, or was in a bad mood, I just kept giving customers a smile and respect, and it made me feel better. Making somebody feel better makes me feel better. I don’t know if that’s the case for you, but when I followed this mantra, the higher-ups saw me going above and beyond for the company, and were impressed! They wanted to promote me and make me the face of the company to customers. I worked at a Wendy’s, and had only been there for about three months, and they were already going to promote me to crew trainer. They figured I could train anybody, and I did. They always had me working the register so that I could talk to the customers, because if they were having a bad day and being short with the order taker, they’d see me and change that attitude! They would be so happy to see me, all because I gave them respect and a smile. It made working easier, not seeing the same lifeless faces come through the drive-thru everyday, but seeing smiles instead, and getting, “Hey! How you been?!” instead of just them handing money. If you just give the customer something to work with, they’ll send that positive energy back at you. Of course you have some sticklers and the people who just gave up on human interactions, but you lose some and win some. To have this mindset isn’t so hard. Think about it from their point of view! Would you rather have somebody who doesn’t care at all, with a dead look in their eyes and nothing to say, or a worker with purpose and something to say everytime you come to the window, somebody that will engage? I’d rather have the second option. Of course, there are going to be some people who prefer the first option, but hopefully they’ll come around. There was a guy, his name was Jim Bob. He was always so grumpy, and let everybody around him know that he’s grumpy. So one day I asked him, “Hey Jim, how was your day? Anything new happen?” He told me that he just got back from the hospital because his mother’s heart was failing, which she’d been dealing with for a while. I gave words of encouragement and comfort and a free drink. He came in the next day happy. He had been grumpy all his life, but he came in with a smile, asking me the same question I asked him the day before. He said his mother was doing better, that the talk we had yesterday really helped him, and he’s been coming into Wendy’s happy to see me ever since. It feels good because he was one of the worst customers before. We dreaded seeing him, but now he’s a’ regular. I have a couple more stories from other places where I’ve worked. You probably don’t want to hear them. They’re longer than that one. Nonetheless, it’s a way of making yourself and others happy, and it is important for a business when you give their customers good service. They’ll want to come back to be treated nicely, and it gives you a confidence boost. There’s a saying at another job, “leave your troubles at the door when you come into work.” I like that quote because it made me good at customer service and a better person. It made me the man I am today. I regret working at the job, but I don’t regret what I’ve learned. Have fun with it as well. Try to make some friends. Don’t be too pushy, but whenever they come to visit, it should feel good; give you a little pep boost in the middle of the day. Going to work and seeing somebody you know there just makes it easier.

"Today, I will be talking about the trip I took to London with my three other friends. At first we decided how to get there without having to pay anything at all. We researched the cheapest price to get to London and back without using any expensive public transports, such as the train or a national express bus. Our aim was to get the transport as low as ten dollars per person round-trip. Finally, we decided to meet at my home and research into the transport. After that, we had a talk about how to plan the journey back to London. It was three of my friends and myself. It was a perfect getaway after all the coursework and exams at the end of the first semester of my master’s program. Finally, we decided to take Megabus to  Victoria Coach Station in London. We found cheap tickets as low as five dollars for a single ticket per person and, for a return, four dollars per person. We were happy with this decision to go to London using Megabus. The bus stop is close to my home, approximately a fifteen-minute walk away. After that, we discussed what type of activities we should go for. For example, which museums should we visit? My friends have never seen the London Eye or other famous London areas. So we asked Google for a quick tips on how to get the best service we can on our journey. After that, we found the five top places to visit in London, which are the London Eye, a few other good museums, and some parks. So we settled in and went for an early night’s rest because our itinerary started at 6 a.m. We would get to London within two hours. From there, we went straight to the nearest food chain where we could get some good-quality breakfast for a good price. We went to some local London cafe where we had coffee and some other snacks. After that, we went for a walk to Buckingham Palace. It took fifteen to thirty-five minutes of walking, with several stops along the way to look around on the way to the Palace. From there, we had a look at the Palace. It was incredibly beautiful and we all enjoyed it. We all took several photos at the Palace and shared them across Facebook and Instagram so that our friends back home in Coventry can view them. From there, we had a walk around the Palace and read every quote we could find which highlights the importance of this palace. From there, we had a walk to local places such as Big Ben and had the opportunity to take a picture in front of it. We also took a picture in front of the famous London Eye. Unfortunately, we could not enter the London Eye because it was closed for a week due to repairs. But that didn’t stop us. We took several pictures of the London Eye and we all moved on. By then, we had walked about five miles and we were all tired. So we decided to get some good fast food. We met at a local London Chinese food place that specializes in noodles. We liked the place, but not the price. At that moment, a single package of noodles cost eight dollars and extra 2.50 for a drink. So we had a talk and we all decided to capitalize on this fabulous offer. Then, we all ordered three different varieties of noodles from this shop. One friend ordered a vegetarian option, another friend ordered chicken and beer, and I ordered chicken, pork, and beef with a Coca-Cola along with it. We paid approximately around twelve dollars each. We were not happy with the price we paid, but we figured it was for the experience. It took us a good forty minutes to finish the food. Two of my friends couldn’t finish the food due to excess food and if was covered in oil and little bit spicy. So I ate their food, too, except for the vegetarian option because I prefer meat. Then, we went past several other stops, such as museums. One of the museums we went to is called the British History Museum. It was huge in size and we all liked the entrance. In the entrance there was a guy selling beautiful old-style cashew nuts, which we all bought since they only cost two dollars per pack. From there, we went inside the museum and it was beautifully designed. We all liked it and its diverse range of collections. We all went our separate ways. I went to the Egyptian collection, my friend went to the African collection and another friend went to the Asian collection. It took a good three hours for us to meet up after the museum, but it was worth it and we all liked it. We all had a rest and came up with the idea to just to see a local movie for a while before we figure out what to do next. Then, we carried on moving and going to places that seemed interesting to us so that we could take good pictures and move on. From there, we went to a different theater or museum that was showing an  art collection. It was a great art collection and we all liked it. And it only took us twenty minutes to view this art collection because of its boring acts. We didn’t like it and we moved on walking to the other parts of thestreet. It was great, but the day was getting short. We all want to go to KFC to find good food for a bargain. From there, we waited for a bus service .

"For these types of NPRs, you want to use the reason code unable to reroute. This would be one of the few NPRs that it isn’t necessary to forward to delivery research for review. There are also two different types of exchanges: prepaid exchange and advanced exchange. A prepaid exchange would be if the customer needed a different size or a different color. A prepaid exchange would be processed if the exchange is  not our fault. The customer would be charged upfront for the exchange and would be refunded once the original item was returned and processed. An advanced exchange shouldn’t be used very often. This type of exchange would be used if there was a service error on our part. For example, if we sent the wrong item, the wrong color, or if they received a defective product, we would process the exchange as an advanced exchange. These are processed on our courtesy account. This means that the customer isn’t charged upfront. However, they must return the wrong or defective item within thirty days. If the item isn’t returned within thirty days, the credit card on file will be charged for the item that was not returned. It is very important to let the customer know that the item must be returned to our warehouse by mail within thirty days. If returned in a store, the charge will still generate, as we don’t use the same system for mail orders as we do for the store. If this happens, please contact CCL for resolution. It is also a good idea to tell the customer to keep a copy of the tracking number for the return in case  the returned package gets lost or stolen. For packages that are lost or stolen, we will send out a replacement at no charge, as long as the customer doesn’t have another NPR for a stolen package within the last six months. We don’t have a time limit on returns. Returns are always free. Most packages will arrive with a prepaid return label and form. However, to save on costs, packages shipping from a full-time store may not have a prepaid return label and form included. If the customer needs a label, they can go to Nordstrom’s website and type returns in the search box. They will be able to print out as many prepaid return labels and forms as they need here. Returns are processed within ten to fourteen business days. Refunds are automatically issued to the original form of payment on file. If a gift card or Nordstrom note was used, a refund will be issued in the form of a gift card. Gift cards will be shipped to the original shipping address and arrive within three to six business days. Gift recipients are also able to return items by mail and in store, or they can also print out a return label and form from our website. It is very important that they fill out the gift recipient section on the form to ensure that the exchange or refund is shipped to them and not the gift giver. They may also take their return to the store as well. The sales associate may try to locate the original purchase. They may be able to do so with the name and zip code or phone number of the gift giver. If they are unable to locate the order this way, the gift recipient will be refunded the last sale price of the item. For example, if the item is now on sale for 50% less, they will be refunded that amount without proof of purchase. Nordstrom offers in store gift wrapping to customers as a courtesy. Sadly, the gift wrapping service for online orders costs two dollars per order. We understand that this may upset some customers. However, our warehouses aren’t as easily equipped with these supplies or manpower. Customers can also take items that they purchased online to their local Nordstrom for free gift wrapping. Nordstrom offers a wonderful rewards program for our loyal customers. It is called Nordstrom Rewards. Customers can earn two points per dollar spent when using a Nordstrom brand payment method. This can be the Nordstrom Visa, debit card, or retail card. This doesn’t include a gift card. If a customer would like to use their own credit or debit card, they earn one point per dollar. For every 2,000 points earned, they will receive a twenty dollar note in the mail or via email. These notes can be used online and in stores — at Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, or HauteLook. These expire after one year and cannot be reissued if they expire before the customer uses the note. If you receive any calls from customers regarding their credit account, we don’t have access to that information. In such cases, please transfer them to Nordstrom Credit. They are also available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Should you be working in the email queue and receive a time sensitive email, please call the customer.","For these NPRs, use the reason code unable to reroute. This is one of the few NPRs that it isn’t necessary to forward to delivery research. There are two different types of exchanges: prepaid and advanced. A prepaid exchange would be if the customer needed a different size or a color. A prepaid exchange is processed if the exchange isn’t our fault. The customer is charged upfront and is refunded once the original item is returned. An advanced exchange shouldn’t be used often. This type of exchange is used if there’s an error on our part. If we sent the wrong item, the wrong color, or if they received a defective product, we process the exchange as an advanced exchange. These are processed on our courtesy account. This means the customer isn’t charged upfront. They must return the wrong or defective item within thirty days. If the item isn’t returned within thirty days, the  card on file will be charged. The customer must know that the item must be returned to our warehouse by mail within thirty days. If returned in a store, the charge will still generate, as we don’t use the same system for mail orders as for the store. If this happens, please contact CCL. Tell the customer to keep a copy of the tracking number for the return in case the package gets lost or stolen. In those cases, we will send out a replacement at no charge, as long as the customer doesn’t have another NPR for a stolen package within the last six months. We have no time limit on returns.

"Also known as Scrum, agile development is a form of project management used to develop products. This methodology is different from the standard methodology, which is waterfall. In waterfall, there is a “gate 2” at the start (and end) of each development phase. The various phases in waterfall are requirements gathering, testing, development (programming), and deployment. In contrast to Agile, waterfall doesn’t not have rollbacks.: Once a stage is complete, there is no way of modifying it. That has frequently been considered a disadvantage. On the other hand, in Agile, there are multiple iterations during which one can mouify requirements. The goal of Agile is to develop a deployable application by the end of every iteration (also called a “sprint”). Each sprint is usually comprised of a two week period. In Agile(which is also known as Scrum), there is a constant feedback loop. The principles of Agile development can be found in the Agile Manifesto which is found online.  The sifferent Agile methodologies are: Scrum (most popular), Scrum illustration, Scrum roles, Scrum ceremonies, Scrum (daily), sprint demo, and Scrum artifacts. When does one use Agile over waterfall? When one has to quickly develop a project in a domain where there is already a lot of work done. In comparison, waterfall can be used whenit’s actually the other way around. Another type of agile development is Lean (LEAN), which commonly uses Kanban boards. These are boards that have different stages (like To Do, In Progress, Done), and everyone is assigned to that project, to a certain task. In Agile there is also what is called retrospectives, which are a way to keep the team up to date with what has been done. In Retros, as they are commonly called, there are many different methods to do this. For example, a common method is to use Post-it notes to create three categories: mad, sad, glad. very person has to write a few things they are mad/sad/glad about, then the master of ceremonies tells everyone to put the notes up on the board and he groups the common topics together. Then there is a round of voting, which is done by the “dots” method, in which everyone gets two to three dots. They vote on one of the topics, then the Scrum master of ceremonies writes or discusses the topics in order of priority. Another commonly done thing is the “ball” method, which works by giving a ball to someone in the team,then only the person that holds the ball can talk about the problems or events in the team. The other team members can ask for the ball by having their hand raised, and the ball is passed in a circle to the person on the right or just by selecting someone with their hand up. Retros are good because they help analyse the outcome of a sprint. They also help to prioritize important topics. This is called timeboxing. Teams can often get bored of doing the same Retro method every week, so the team has to keep the Retro method fresh every week, or every two weeks. Agile is commonly used for test-driven development, Test-driven development is a way of developing by writing tests before you write any code. When the code is compiled, the tests are run against it, and you know which tests run and which don’t, which gives a good idea of how to do the test. In Java, a common thing to use to write tests is called JUnit, and there are four versions.JUnit 4 is the most commonly used one at the moment. Other tools are like Docker and Mockito help with writing mock tests. For example, you need a database and  you don’t actually have a database, but you have some code that uses a database. You can create a mock of the database without actually making a database, because making databases is very tedious, That’s an example. Another example is using coded completion in IDEs. This is done by scanning the libraries of the programming language. Test-driven development is also used to keep track of good code in Git or Git-like programs, because every time someone commits, the tests are passed, and you can see who commited what and if it runs or not. An advantage of this, which is called continuous integration, is that when you are commiting code at least daily, you can always have the option to rollback to the last version of the program that was properly running. Other examples of Git-like programs are Jenkins and Bamboo. Do note that Git is for GitLab and GitHub. They are not different versions of Git, they are just web portals that belong to different companies, but they still use Git on the backend. When one comes across Agile and Git, one is also taught all about web services and REST. REST is a universal API standard which tells programs how to transmit things so that they are standardised. For example, JSON is a very global form of transmitting data. Virtually any modern programming language uses JSON to transfer data between different environments, like between a web server and a Java server. APIs commonly use JSON to transfer data, like Twilio, which uses services to send SMs to carriers all over the world, but one does not have to see their code implementation. The whole idea behind APIs is that you can just call universal functions, and they will handle everything else.In the case of Twilio, you can just call a function that gets sent to them with a country code, phone number and a message to be sent.hey will handle all the code details about how to get the message sent to a specific country, and take into account all of the carriers that are available. APIs are the statement that models, “Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.”","Also known as Scrum, agile development is a project management used to develop products.

Nothing should ever be too much of a hassle, and it is important to show this on your face. Customers pick up on non-verbal communication in addition to what is coming out of your mouth.

If I had a dollar for the amount of stupid requests I have heard, I would be an incredibly rich gal. You have to pretend it’s not silly, and that it’s actually reasonable.

"Today we are going to talk about the music industry. Over the years, the music industry has changed drastically. Going from record and CD stores to everything being completely digital has opened up new doors to many different opportunities, but also shut doors for many companies. In the early 2000s, there were CD stores, record stores, and video stores littering every strip and plaza across the US. Slowly, those stores began to diminish due to digital stores and sites such as Limewire, iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, and now YouTube Music. To say that the digital age has had an effect on this would be an understatement. Children who were born in the late ‘90s and early 2000s spearheaded this digital advancement. Not only were music stores affected, but video stores were affected as well. How long has it been since we’ve even heard about Blockbuster? Netflix has also gone completely digital now. In the past, they used to send out DVDs monthly to their subscribers. This all has to do with ease of access. Not only as Americans, but as humans, we like to find an easy way out of situations and we love when things are available right then and there at our fingertips. It allows us to save our time and spend it on something more important. Being able to unlock your mobile device and/or sign onto your laptop and have the world literally at your fingertips allows for less time to be spent getting in your car and driving to the store to purchase what you were looking for. This, however, was very bad for physical stores. A huge financial decline ensued, as more and more people began to convert to the digital stores. Imagine this: You spend so much money on renting or leasing a business, then to acquire the product, and also to publicize your business for several years, just for some digital store to take all of your customers. Something that you’ve worked on for a very long time has been uprooted by a program that was just created in the span of a year. Financially, you’re struggling, so you have to eventually close down your shop and find something else to bring in the big bucks. Although there are still a few physical shops out there, they are mainly for older generations who still own the devices to play back the material. Most youth from this generation wouldn’t even know how a Walkman worked, even if the instructions were right next to them. At the rate that physical stores were going out of style, so were the playback devices. From Walkmans to CD players, MP3 players, and handheld radio devices, they are rarely seen today. You can now access the material you want to listen to or watch and the playback device within one console: a laptop, tablet, iPad, or other mobile device. This saves us, the consumers, money as well. Instead of having to spend money on the material and the device, we make a one-time payment on the device and several small payments on the material. Unfortunately, this has made us lazier. Movie nights, binge watching, and TV series have allowed for us to be more stagnant in the work that we do everyday if we let them. We have to motivate ourselves to get physical throughout the day when everything is, again, at our fingertips. Most physical store owners were not left behind. After realizing that those stores were no longer a necessity, they began investing in their own competition. This allowed them to reap the benefits of what the competitor is making and receiving.","Today we will talk about the drastic changes in the music industry, over the years.

"The world of the Internet is very wide. In our era you will find a lot of interesting technology that would complete your day-to-day life. This new trend is leveraging the concept of the Internet of Things. These devices that were in the past not connected to the Internet are now available in all retailers. This becomes more and more popular and it all started with the fitness bands. These are bands that let you count all your steps and activity. At first these devices were not very smart or powerful but they were good at doing simple things. Pedometers are the ancestors of fitness bands. The development of these bands is quite impressive. They now have a lot of features and capabilities. People don’t use them to their full potential. The data that is provided by those type of bands can be analysed in such a way that would allow the user to deeply understand their habits. For example, if you see that the step count is very low, you can assume that someone is either sleeping or sedentary. The combination of those steps and other metrics would give you the answer but if we focus on the steps for the moment, you will realise that most of the time people have very similar habits. Their steps could be the same over and over. This is normal and quite expected. Based on that information a model can be created where we can predict what the user will do. For example if a person goes to work every morning at 8:00 a.m. for a long time, the day that the steps count doesn’t go up around that time will allow us to determine that a break in the habit occured. For more information, you can combine the steps with information like the heart rate. Nowadays the devices have those markers quite easily available. The heart rate is even more powerful that the steps. There are only a few moments that can be defined when the heart rate is changing. Either someone is awake and moving around (not exercising), going to the gym, doing exercises, or lying in bed. The last is quite easily identifiable. If you correlate the heart rate with the time of the day, you can assume that the person is sleeping with a good confidence score. The other opportunity that the measurement of the heart rate  allows is to see if someone is under pressure or under stress. By combining the steps with the heart rate, you can have a model that is quite accurate for any sort of activity. For example, if the step count is very low and the heart rate is low, it’s quite obvious that the person is sleeping. If the heart rate is high but step count is low, it’s likely to be gym exercise or treadmill. I’ve never seen a low heart rate and high steps,but I would guess it’s probably an athlete going for a run that doesn’t impact his heart rate. The risk of having those devices collect more data is significant. The manufacturers haven’t used the full potential of the data that is available to them. Instead of analysing and reviewing deeply the information that they have they tend to rush into having more sensors. Those sensors are not always the answer. They can consume battery and therefore not be as good of an option as we think. Unfortunately, manufacturers have to innovate. To me the real innovation is having the ability to make the data talk and to be very good at using the existing technology that allows you to move forward. Being comfortable with the basic technologies is critical for today’s companies. The new and shiny gadgets are not a real demonstration of a company’s innovation. We have had flexible screens for many years but the utilisation as of today is still to be proven. The innovative department of Google called Google X has released nice gadgets from their work but they are not in any way, shape, or form usable by the end users. This is not the future that we should have, and our companies should be more focused on the end user instead of the image that they send. Those parts of the Internet of things are very useful to me. They simply need to be triaged. There are now toothbrushes, umbrellas, and other basic things that we use that are connected. I have difficulty understanding what the purpose of a connected umbrella is. The website advertises that if you forget your umbrella you get a notification. I’m not convinced at all. The same idea with the connected luggages. While it’s good when you lose your luggage to know where it is, I’m not sure how often you will be using that functionality. There is some big filtering to be done in this area and the users are starting to realise that not everything should be connected, as there is no point in doing so. The other trend that is associated with connected devices is the artificial intelligence and machine learning. This to me is the real innovation as long as simple rules are followed. The most important rule for an AI to revolutionize the life or work of someone is that the data it’s collecting is clean. There is an expression in the software industry that says “garbage in, garbage out.” The AI is not a magic tool that would change everything. It will help gradually to understand the amount of data that we have and to make it easily readable for humans. AI doesn’t work on its own. It relies on big data. AI has been around since the ‘50s. One of the first applications of AI was word processing following the scanning of a document. That was a great technology development but nowadays there isn’t a lot of documents that we scan and that we want to turn into text that can be processed.

"An example of this is as follows: Imagine a customer is on a two-part rate and used 1000 kWh on average during the time period, so that is their baseline.  Prior to the time period, the customer receives notification that the marginal rate is $2/kWh because of a flood at the generation site. The standard rate is $0.15/kWh, so they will pay $0.15 * 1000, or $15 for the base rate. But then anything over that amount gets very expensive ($2/kWh), so they will not want any additional usage. (For example, if they added an assembly line, it could cost them thousands to run it.) But if they shut down totally and are in a two-part rate that provides rebates, they will then get a credit of almost $2000 for that period!

"For example, the designer might want to lay out a desktop design that has text in three columns across the page. The designer will use Bootstrap classes to lay out the text in three page columns by making each text element the width of four grid columns. Those same three columns can then be condensed to two columns next to each other and one stacked below on a smaller-sized screen such as a tablet, also by using Bootstrap classes. To take it one step further, each of the three text elements can stretch across an entire screen, stacked in one long column, with more help from Bootstrap.","For example, it may be in the designer’s best interests to lay out a computer desktop design that consists of three individual columns lined up across the page.

Those same three columns can then be further condensed into a triangular formation consisting of two columns placed next to each other and atop the third, which is in turn placed alone on a smaller, tablet-sized screen beneath the other two. This set-up may sound complicated, but it can also easily be accomplished with the help of Bootstrap classes. This process can be taken a step even further by allowing each of the text elements to fill an entire screen by themselves, and placing each of these screens atop one another in a long column. This arrangement of screens may also sound daunting to construct at first, but this too can easily be accomplished with a little more help from Bootstrap.

"Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art/combat sport that is based on grappling and submissions (ground fighting). It is a mixture of Judo and Japanese Jiu Jitsu. The Gracie family, Helio Gracie in particular, popularised and created what is considered the massive powerhouse martial art in MMA (Mixed martial arts). It promotes the concept of smaller and weaker people being able to control and dominate a bigger and stronger opponent. Since Helio Gracie was a smaller man, his demonstrations and his sparringss conclusively proved that technique beats strength almost all the time. And ever since then, the sport of BJJ has evolved  by the following generations.  Competitions have popularised it even further than its originating country, Brazil, thus making it a global phenomenon. The Gracie family also had a hand in helping to create the rules for the UFC.","Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art and combat sport that is based on grappling and submissions, which pertain to fighting on the ground. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a mixture of Judo and Japanese Jiu Jitsu. Judo, which also originated in Japan, does not emphasized ground fighting, but instead focus on throwing techniques and quick movement to unbalance an opponent. On the other hand Jiu Jitsu employs holds, throws, and paralyzing blows to subdue an opponent. The Gracie family, Helio Gracie in particular, popularized and created the self defense system of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It is also a combat sport that has become the main and essential style used in Mixed Marital Arts or MMA. It promotes the concept of a smaller and weaker person being able to control and dominate a bigger and stronger opponent. In order to demonstrate that this system could allow the smaller and weaker to win against a larger opponent, Helio Gracie, who was a smaller man himself, sparred against larger opponents. He proved that technique beats strength almost all the time. And ever sine them the sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has evolved as the following generations practice this system. In addition, competitions have popularized it far beyond its originating country of Brazil. Thus, it become a global phenomenon. Since the Gracie family created one of the most important combat or self defense systems of all time, they become influential in the creation for the rule set of the UFC.

"I will be discussing the proper way to make Starbucks beverages. Many of the drinks can be prepared very quickly by dispensing them from insulated containers, such as the coffee and  hot water thermals, and the iced coffee and tea dispensers. For many Starbucks customers, their interest tends to venture into more difficult-to-craft drinks. In order to make a latte, you must first steam the milk. This is done by pouring the customer’s choice of milk into a silver, canister-like device, then inserting a heated rod that will blow steam into the milk. Be sure to insert only the tip at first, allowing it to heat only the surface, and then lift the rod out a moment before plunging it all the way in. This will prevent a, frankly, disturbing and loud noise that the machine will make if the rod is inserted directly into cold milk, so it is encouraged that we do it this way to prevent disturbing our customers and ourselves. The thing to do once the milk is settled in and steaming, is to put in the customer’s choice of syrup. A latte does not, by default, come with syrup, and syrup often costs extra, but many people still sweeten them. The correct, default amount of syrup for the sizes are as follows: two pumps in a tall, four pumps in a grande, and five pumps in a venti. If the venti is iced, an additional pump should be added for a total of six, as the iced venti cups are a little bit bigger than the hot cups. Then, it is time to draw the espresso shots from the espresso machine. This is done simply with the click of a button. Talls get one shot. Grandes and ventis get two shots, and iced ventis get three. It is crucial not to let the espresso sit without introducing the milk for any more than ten seconds, as prolonged exposure to the air will sour it and give it a distinctly unpleasant taste. Pour the steamed milk into it slowly, encouraging the non-foamy milk to enter it first, and the foam to rest on top. Some people encourage less-practiced employees to use a spoon in order to hold back the foam initially, then release it at the end. If you steam the milk just right, you will be able to make latte art in it by pouring it in a distinct way. That is how to make a latte. A macchiato is prepared by pouring the shots on top at the end, after the milk and syrup are in the cup. A cappuccino is made by making the milk more steamy by keeping the rod near the top for longer. It contains more foam.","Today, I will be discussing the proper way to make Starbucks beverages. It is important to note that many of the drinks can be prepared very quickly by dispensing them from insulated containers, such as the coffee and hot water thermals, and the iced coffee and tea dispensers. For many Starbucks customers, their interest tends to venture into more difficult-to-craft drinks. These difficult-to-craft drinks are like lattes. Lattes are important part of the Starbucks menu so it is pretty important to understand how they are made. In order to make a latte, you must first steam the milk. This is done by pouring the customer’s choice of milk into a silver, canister-like device, then inserting a heated rod that will blow steam into the milk. Be sure to insert only the tip at first, allowing it to heat only the surface, because you do not want to curdle the milk, and then lift the rod out a moment before plunging it all the way in. Doing this will prevent a, frankly, disturbing and loud noise that the machine will make if the rod is inserted directly into cold milk, so it is encouraged that we do it this way to prevent disturbing our customers and ourselves. And believe me, you do not want to hear that sound 100 times a day as you make lattes for customers, either. So, it is important to practice this technique and avoid that terrible noise.
Next, the thing to do once the milk is settled in and steaming, is to put in the customer’s choice of syrup. Although a latte does not, by default, come with syrup, and syrup often costs extra, you will find that many people still sweeten them. The correct or default amount of syrup for the sizes are as follows: two pumps in a tall, four pumps in a grande, and five pumps in a venti. If the venti is iced, an additional pump should be added for a total of six, as the iced venti cups are a little bit bigger than the hot cups.
Then, it is time to draw the espresso shots from the espresso machine. Thankfully this is a simple task. Drawing the espresso out of the machine is done simply with the click of a button. Now, Talls get one shot, while grandes and ventis get two shots. Lastly, iced ventis, similar to when they get syrup, get an extra shot of espresso, which means you put three shots into them. It is crucial not to let the espresso sit without introducing the milk for any more than ten seconds, as prolonged exposure to the air will sour it and give it a distinctly unpleasant taste. If you do let this happen, do not be surprised if you have to remake this drink for the costumer. Pour the steamed milk into it slowly, encouraging the non-foamy milk to enter it first, so that the foam can come and rest on top. Some people encourage less-practiced employees to use a spoon in order to hold back the foam initially, then release it at the end. You can utilize this method until you are comfortable enough to attempt it without the spoon. If you steam the milk just right, you will be able to make latte art in it by pouring it in a distinct way. Of course, this particular part is more of a fun fact and not required for you to do. That is how to make a latte.
Now there are two other drinks made at Starbucks as well, which a macchiato and a cappuccino. These are kind of alterations of the latte. For example, a macchiato is prepared by pouring the shots on top at the end, after the milk and syrup are in the cup. Whereas, A cappuccino is made by making the milk more steamy by keeping the rod near the top for longer, which means it will contain more foam. Although the each contains similar ingredients, how those ingredients are inserted into the drink will determine what you are making. Remember not confuse any of the drinks and do not fully insert the rod into cold and all of you should do well at Starbucks.",Add instructions about making Starbucks beverages,elaborate
"Touching more on the subject of lighting, try to use the same color light.  Lights are rated in color from warm to cool.  Warm lights are yellowish red in tint, and cool lights are white or blue colors. They are rated in degrees Kelvin.  The lower the degree K the warmer the light.  Mixing cool and warm lights might provide some cinematic flavor to a shot or scene, but it should be avoided in an educational setting, as it will provide a distraction to students.  As for fluorescent lights, make sure your camera settings do not produce “flicker” when filming them. If this occurs, try adjusting the FPS and the exposure settings.  Make sure you test these settings before you go live!  Another thing to watch out for is lines moving down the screen, this is caused by lights putting out light in a frequency that conflicts with the camera settings.  Some modern cameras have settings to compensate for this.","Regarding the subject of lighting, attempt to use the same color light. Lights are rated in color on a scale from warm to cool. On a color scale, warm lights are yellowish-red in tint, whereas cool lights are white or blue colors. Lights are rated in degrees Kelvin, which is the unit of measurement in thermodynamic temperature. Thermodynamic temperature gauges the amount of total energy stored in an object. 
The lower the light rates in Kelvin, the warmer the light. Warm light is defined as a color temperature below 3300 degrees Kelvin. Cool light is often measured to be 4000 degrees Kelvin and higher. Mixing cool and warm lights has benefits, such as providing cinematic flair to a shot or scene. Furthermore, mixing color temperatures can produce a desired mood in a living room or set an atmospheric tone when listening to music. Unfortunately, mixing light temperatures can have its limitations. When misused, such as in an educational setting, it will distract students. Using light temperatures in this manner can also have an adverse effect when attempting to watch a movie or television. Rather than supply a complimentary mood, it takes away from the desired subject. 
Avoiding a ""flicker"" effect when recording video under fluorescent lighting is essential. Flicker occurs when the light hitting the camera sensor undergoes temporal light modulation. Because the camera sensor samples light intensity discretely (according to the exposure time), rapid fluctuations in light combined with the recording process can create unwanted artifacts. To prevent this, try adjusting the frame rate (fps) and exposure settings, and test these adjustments before filming. Frame rate refers to the number of video frames captured per second, expressed in frames per second. Also, be aware of lines moving from top to bottom on the camera screen, which can be caused by specific light frequencies that conflict with the camera's settings. Luckily, some modern cameras have features to compensate for this, such as manual mode or bulb mode, shutter speed, aperture or F-stop, and ISO.",Elaborate on light temperature,elaborate

"Lunches and breaks are one of the most common things that throw employers off, but they don’t have to be. I’ve found that through training and consistent refresher courses,  managers and supervisors are your best line of defense when it comes to ensuring that everything runs smoothly. You need to start at the top and train the people who are responsible for scheduling and ensuring that everyone takes their breaks and lunches on time. Once you train your managers and supervisors, you can then hold them responsible for their actions, or lack of action, when it comes to ensuring that their employees are on time and receiving the breaks and lunches that they should. It will trickle down from there. Your managers and supervisors will hold their employees accountable for taking their breaks and lunches on time, and very soon you will see that everyone is accountable for making sure that we all follow the law.","Mid day meals, as well as scheduled pauses from work are examples of the most common subjects that are able to disrupt the employer's state of mind, but that does not have to be an inevitability. I have discovered that with the right amount of certified training as well as regularly scheduled courses for the sake of review, managers as well as supervisors are the most ideal individuals to have on your side when it comes to making certain that the work day is running as smoothly as possible. It is extremely suggested for you to begin at the very top of the ladder and train the individuals whose responsibility it is to schedule and make certain that every individual takes their breaks and lunches at the correctly allotted frame of time. When you are able to find the right time to train your managers as well as supervisors, you are then able to hold them responsible for the actions and decisions, or lack of actions and decisions, that they choose to or not to act upon. When it comes to the conflict of making certain that the ones they are supervising are showing up during their scheduled hours, and being given the breaks and lunches that they are legally required to give, it will from there be able to trickle down from that point on. The managers and supervisors you hired will then take it upon themselves to make sure their employees are held accountable for taking their breaks and lunches at their allotted time, and in a short amount of time you will eventually notice that every individual is taking account and making sure that everyone involved in the workplace follows their legal guidelines.",Describe more about how employers deal with employees.,elaborate
"The first thing is customer service. You have to be all for the customer. Once you are willing to give up your first born child (figuratively) for this customer, you are on the right track. Nothing should ever be too much of a hassle, and it is important to show this on your face. Customers pick up on non-verbal communication in addition to what is coming out of your mouth. Their requests may be pretty bloody silly, such as “can I have a pie, but can you remove all the pastry from it?” or “I know I’ve come to a Singaporean restaurant, but do you have anything else not Singaporean, as I don’t really like that type of food?”. If I had a dollar for the amount of stupid requests I have heard, I would be an incredibly rich gal. You have to pretend it’s not silly, and that it’s actually reasonable. If you can’t do what they’re asking, offer them something else to make it seem like you haven’t just completed denied them outright. With fine dining restaurants, customers expect a lot more compared to a bakery. They want to be greeted at the door. They want to be taken to their table straight away. For Heaven’s sake do not make them wait. That first introduction is crucial.","The absolute first thing that needs to be kept in mind is customer service. Everything must revolve around the whims of the customer. Only once you are willing to sacrifice your firstborn child for the good of the customer (figuratively speaking) have you begun to understand the mindset you will need to radiate. Nothing should ever be too much of a hassle for you, no task too small nor request too absurd. Furthermore you must wear this philosophy on your sleeve at all times, proclaiming to the world with your eyes and with your expressions that you do not mind performing these petty services in the slightest. On the contrary, in fact, you must love to serve the customer, you must express nothing but pure delight in every chance you get to help them attain their desires, again no matter how ridiculous or degrading the request.
This is because they can tell. The customers know when you let the mask slip. They are capable of using their adept senses of non-verbal communication to read your true thoughts even as you deliver your well-practiced but ultimately fruitless customer service spiel. Remember, customers delight in making the most absurd of requests and will often poke at the edges of your carefully prepared mental defenses with questions such as,  “can I have a pie, but can you remove all the pastry from it?” or “I know I’ve come to a Singaporean restaurant, but do you have anything else not Singaporean, as I don’t really like that type of food?”. 
If I had been given a dollar for every odd, ridiculous , or downright preposterous customer request I’d fielded in my time, I would be a very rich woman today. But no matter what, no matter how ridiculous the request, it is paramount that you appear to carefully consider it, and pretend that it is not the most galling nonsense you’d heard since the last customer request. Furthermore, it is important that you offer them an alternative to their utterly impossible requests if they turn out to be impossible. This is because a customer can never be denied, only gently redirected towards less destructive options.
These rules apply all the more so in a fine dining setting, since the customers there are expecting a level of service and deference to match the exorbitant fees they are likely paying to dine in such an establishment. These patrons are expecting a level of service that goes above and beyond even the near reverence expected in typical customer service settings. Under no circumstances should you make such patrons wait for service, the first impression is the most important after all. ",Elaborate on the expectations of customer service employees. ,elaborate

"It is important to choose an appropriate lab for the occasion when setting out to design an inquiry-based unit. Some labs that require specialized equipment that needs detailed instructions in order to understand how it is operated may not be a good choice for this type of activity. An inquiry-based lab is better suited as an exploratory introduction to a chapter, instead of a detailed rigorous data collection study. Inquiry-based labs can be integrated into almost all physics units, even those that intuitively do not make sense at first. For example, when beginning to teach a unit on Newton’s law of universal gravitation, it is difficult to get students to understand a concept that they cannot see. The laws of gravity that hold the universe together are invisible to students, and they cannot begin to comprehend a force of gravity different than that experienced between themselves and their own planet. Trying to go over advanced calculations for other planets can be a boring and unrewarding task for them. However, giving each lab group an open-ended question in the guided-inquiry format can be a very effective means of opening up their minds to this new chapter. NASA and other educational non-profits have online tools that students can explore to simulate gravity on other planets. With a lab notebook in hand, students should be given some online resources and a general question, such as “What color would the sky be on Mars?” or “How would it feel to run and jump on the surfaces of other planets?” Using online computer simulations is an extremely effective way of engaging students in following their own lines of inquiry in a focused way that is also exposing them to the content. Computer-based learning also has the distinct advantage of allowing different groups of learners to discover and learn at various places.","It is essential to choose a proper lab for the occasion when setting out to design an inquiry-based unit. While selecting such a lab, it is important to keep in mind that it must enable students to understand concepts and encourage them to explore the topic further. There may be many labs that have specialized equipment that needs detailed instructions in order to understand how it is operated, and these may not be a good choice for this type of activity because it will overcomplicate the process and confuse the students. While these labs may be fascinating, they may not be suitable for inquiry-based learning. Students may spend more time trying to understand how to use the equipment instead of exploring the topic at hand. It will divert them from the process of learning. However, an inquiry-based lab is better suited overall as an exploratory introduction to a chapter than a detailed, rigorous data collection study. There are many advantages to inquiry-based labs due to their flexibility and adaptability, as they can be integrated into almost all physics units, even those that intuitively makes no sense at all in the beginning and are very difficult to understand at first. It can help students visualize the concept and make it more tangible by using models, demonstrations, and hands-on activities. For example, when a teacher starts to introduce a unit on Newton’s law of universal gravitation, it is difficult to get students to understand and analyze a concept that they cannot see. They may struggle to follow the concepts. The laws of gravity that hold the universe together are not visible to students, and they cannot begin to understand the force of gravity. They would not understand what connects them to their own planet or the important role that gravity plays in the universe. If they are asked to do advanced calculations for other planets, it can be a dull, monotonous, and unrewarding task for the students. They might not work diligently for it. But if students are taught in a creative way that breaks the monotony and makes them curious and open, they can effectively learn the concepts promptly. If each lab group is provided with an open-ended question in the guided-inquiry format, it can be an amazing way to open up their minds and visualize basic concepts and any new chapter. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and other educational non-profits have various tools available online that can help students explore and simulate gravity on other planets. These are amazing resources to get in-depth knowledge about STEM topics. Students can explore varied information on the subject by going through the websites. So, students must be provided with a lab notebook in hand and should be given some online resources and a general question, such as ""What color would the sky be on Mars?"" or ""How would it feel to run and jump on the surfaces of other planets?""

It is an activity unlike anything the majority of people have ever done, and is an excellent way to immerse people in a completely new environment.  Sailing a square rigger vessel has challenges and excitement that brings out the best in people. It also brings people into much closer contact with the elements than most people now ever experience. Letting the wind and waves dictate your movements is part of the challenge and excitement, because you have to learn to cooperate with the elements to sail. If you resist and fight against, you will encounter struggles. In addition, you also get to spend most of the day outside on water, feeling the sun on your skin. You will see nature way closer as well. Even on a short sail near the GTA, it can be incredible how separate you feel out on the lake, even while the CN tower is still visible in the distance. It is our hope that you will join in this program and start your sailing experience today.",Add more details about the benefits of sailing.,elaborate

"Radio commercials are much cheaper than television advertisements and can reach a lot of people too. The importance here is the same as with television though. You have to make sure you’re airing your commercial on the right station, and at the right time. If your most likely potential customer is going to be on his way to work in the morning, you don’t want to invest in a middle-of-the-night commercial, because it’s probably not going to pay off. You can also have the same advertisement on multiple stations, and that might work too.","Radio advertisements are significantly less expensive than their television commercial counterparts, yet retain the ability to reach a wide audience. The important underlying factors remain the same between these two varieties of advertising, however. Namely, that it is vital for you to be certain that your commercial is airing on the correct station at the most ideal time. For instance, if the most likely potential consumers of your product are likely driving to work in the mornings, then it would be foolish to invest your time and resources into a middle-of-the-night commercial. It is fairly safe to assume that such an investment would not pay off in an ideal manner. Another viable option is to run the same advertisement across multiple stations, increasing your chances of reaching your target audience significantly with each additional station. This strategy is not without its drawbacks however, since each additional station will also increase your total advertising costs significantly. Just as it is important to select the most appropriate time-slot for your advertisement to reach its target audience then, it is equally important to select the most appropriate station to reach your target audience. For instance, suppose that you are offering a service teaching English as a second language. In that case it would be a far better idea to place your advertisements on a predominantly Spanish speaking station’s network than with an English speaking network that your target audience probably isn’t listening to.",Provide some more examples of wise advertisment placement choices.,elaborate

The use of human translators as opposed to computerised translators is essential to the success of our translation work. Translators are suited to the required brief with fluency in the languages they are required to utilise. The quality of our work is paramount, with our translators taking into account the nuances and complexities associated with their specific languages. This service cannot be replaced with automated programmes such as Google Translate, as the translations resulting from their automated services are riddled with errors grammatically and in terms of overall meaning.

Our company is in a position to provide translation services of the highest quality. Other companies are simply unable to compete with the exceptional services we offer. The first key difference between our services and those of our competitors is that we rely exclusively on human translators, never stooping to the use of computerized knock-offs. Each of our translators are required to demonstrate complete fluency in the languages they are assigned to assist with. Beyond that, they are also required to demonstrate deep understandings of the complexities and cultural nuances associated with each language. The quality of our translations is by far the most important factor in our business model, and such devotion to excellence simply cannot be replicated with automated programs such as Google Translate. The translations conducted by such software are ill-equipped to handle the sort of cultural nuance that our translators specialize in, and so the work of these programs often ends up containing significant grammatical errors and deviations in meaning from the original text.

The police have the ability to request information about the number of spectators on site at any given time, so it is utterly crucial that we always have an accurate estimate of the number of people currently on site. This necessitates the construction of a fence around the green with foot traffic limited to passing through designated entrances and exits only. Limiting the free movement of people in this way is an essential step that needs to be taken in order for security to stand any chance of maintaining an accurate headcount throughout the event. The costs of renting, constructing, maintaining, and eventually deconstructing this fence will obviously raise the overall costs of running this event, but that is unavoidable. We are currently undergoing quote negotiations with Herras fencing for these purposes, as well as actively searching for a sponsor who might help us mitigate these increased costs with a donation covering the price of the fence rental, or its setup and takedown, or ideally, both.

"The control of fire was the first great discovery of humankind, because it changed all of their lives.To the early man, fire was a divine gift randomly delivered in the form of lighting  forest fire, or burning lava.

How  man learnt how to produce flame at will is unknown. It was probably a secondary invention. European peasants would insert a wooden drill in a round hole and rotate it briskly between their palms. This process could be sped up by wrapping a cord around the drill and pulling on each end. The Ancient Greeks used lenses or concave mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays, and burning glasses were also used by Mexican Aztecs and the Chinese. These methods of fire-lighting date back to Paleolithic times, when some Stone Age tool-makers discovered that chipping flints produced sparkes. The technique became more efficient after the discovery of iron, about five thousand years ago. In North America, the Eskimos produced a slow-burning spark by striking quartz against iron pyrites, a compound that contains sulphur. The Chinese lit their fires by striking porcelain with bamboo. Tinder remained the main method of fire-lighting until the middle of the 19th century. Fire lighting was revolutionised by the discovery of phosphorus, isolated in 1669 by a German alchemist trying to transmute silver into gold. Impressed by the element’s combustibility, several 17th century chemists used it to manufacture fire-lighting devices, but the results were dangerously inflammable. With phosphorus costing the equivalent of several  The quest for a practical match really began after 1781 ( I am not sure), when a group of French chemists came up with the Phosphoric Candle or Ethereal Match, a sealed glass tube containing a twist of paper tipped with phosphorus. When the tube was broken, air rushed in, causing the phosphorus to combust. Another device popular in the US was the Instantaneous Light Box — a bottle filled with the sulphuric acid, into which splints treated with chemicals were dipped.The first matches resembling those used today were made in 1827 by Walker.Walker was an English pharmacist who borrowed the formula from a military rocket-maker. Walker never patented his invention, and three years later, it was copied by Samuel Jones, who marketed his product as Lucifers. About the same time, a French chemistry student named Charles Sauria produced the first strike-anywhere match by substituting white phosphorus for the potassium chlorate in the Walker formula. However, since white phosphorus is a deadly poison, from 1845 match-makers exposed to its fumes succumbed to necrosis, a disease that eats away jaw bones. It was not until 1906 that the substance was eventually banned. That was about sixty-two years after a Swedish chemist called Pasch had discovered non-toxic red, or amorphous, phosphorus, a development exploited commercially by Pasch’s compatriot in 1885. This contained potassium chlorate, which has a combustion temperature of 182 degrees centigrade. America lagged behind Europe in match technology and safety standards. It was not until 1900 that the Diamond Match Company bought a fresh patent for safety — but it didn’t work in the different climatic conditions prevailing in the US, and it was another eleven years before scientists finally adapted the French patent for the US. The Americans can claim several firsts in match technology and marketing. In 1892, the Diamond Match Company pioneered book matches. The innovation did not catch on until after 1896, when a brewery had the novel idea of advertising its product in matchbooks.Today, book matches are the most widely used type of match in the US, with ninety percent handed out free by hotels, restaurants, and others.","When humans were able to find a way to control fire, what became was an initializing, amazing discovery of our kind, due to the fact that it altered every single one of their, and in turn our lives as well. According to the individuals that were taking part of the early stages of our species, fire became a gift from the heavens that was randomly sent to them in the form of lighting, forest fire, or burning lava. Early humans were not able figure out how to burn wood or leaves to make and control flames for themselves, the earliest human beings most likely stored a low fire by keeping logs that were burning very slowly alight or by hauling charcoal within portable pots. How many people or civilizations were able to learn how to produce and control flame at will is not known at this time. It was most likely an invention that could be considered secondary. In old Europe, there’s evidence of peasants who would put a drill bit made out of wood into a round hole, and begin to spin it between their palms on one end, and within the hole on the other. This is a process that could have been completed faster by tying a cord around the drill and attempting to pull on each end. The Ancient Greeks were the ones that utilized lenses or concave mirrors in order to find a way to manipulate the sun’s rays, and burning glasses were also able to be used by the Mexican Aztecs and the Chinese. 
These methods that people used so that they could ignite and control flame date all the way back to the Paleolithic era, when a number of Stone Age tool makers found out that attempting to chip flints is something that can easily produce sparkes. That technique started becoming even more efficient following people’s discovery of iron and steel, somewhere around five thousand years before now. In the North American continent, the Eskimos were able to produce a spark that would burn very slowly by striking and chipping quartz against iron pyrites, a specific compound that happens to contain sulfur within itself. The Chinese people were able to light their fires by the process of striking and chipping porcelain with bamboo. Tinder stayed as the method of fire-lighting people would usually find themselves doing up until the middle of the nineteenth century. The process of lighting a simple flame was able to be revolutionized due to the discovery of the chemical phosphorus. The chemical was able to be Isolated in the year 1669 by a German alchemist making attempts to transmute silver into gold. Because of the fact that he was impressed by the element’s ability to be combustible, a number of 17th century chemists made attempts to manufacture fire-lighting devices from the chemical, though the results they were able to get only proved the chemical as dangerously inflammable. With phosphorus also simply costing the equivalent of several of the starters they would have liked to make.
The scientist’s mission for a practical match started to really ramp up following the year 1781 ( I am not one hundred percent certain though). This was the year where a group of chemists from the country of France were able to come up with what was known at the time as Phosphoric Candle or what could be considered an Ethereal Match, which was simply a sealed glass tube that contained a piece of paper with a twist at the end that was tipped with phosphorus. The moment the tube is broken by someone, air begins to rush in, which is what is causing the phosphorus to combust. One more device that was popular in the United States was what was called the Instantaneous Light Box, this invention was a bottle which was filled to the brim with the sulphuric acid, it was into this solution that splints that were treated with chemicals were dipped into.The very first matches that and any resemblance to the ones that are used today were made in the year 1827 by a man named Walker. Walker was an Englishman, and had a profession as a pharmacist. He happened to borrow the formula from a person in the military that constructs rockets. Walker, for whatever reason, was never able to patent his invention, and only three years following that, it was then imitated by a man named Samuel Jones, who tried marketing his “new” product as Lucifers. Around the same exact time, there was a French chemistry student that was named Charles Sauria, and he happened to produce the very first strike anywhere match by the process of substituting white phosphorus for what is known as potassium chlorate within the formula that Walker had created. However, due to the fact that white phosphorus is in fact a deadly poison, from 1845 match makers that happened to become exposed to the deadly fumes unfortunately had given into necrosis, a specific disease that has a horrible effect of eating away the bone in an individual’s jaw. It was not until 1906 that the substance was finally able to become banned.
That was somewhere around sixty two years following the actions of a Swedish man that also happened to be a chemist, and simply named Pasch. He happened to find a way to discover  red, or amorphous, phosphorus that was not toxic, which became a development that was eventually exploited commercially by Pasch’s compatriot in 1885. This invention contained potassium chlorate, which has been proven to have a combustion temperature of one hundred eighty two degrees centigrade.

"Aside from slip resistant shoes, there are a few more necessary components to a person's uniform when working in the kitchen. While not all kitchens opt to use them, most kitchen uniforms require an apron to protect the wearer from getting grease, grime, or many other things on their actual restaurant uniform below. Oftentimes this is because if a cook needs to leave the kitchen for whatever reason and go to the front of house, where the customers will be, they should look presentable with a clean uniform, rather than covered in the food that they are preparing. Aprons are also used as a quick means to wipe your hands when necessary.","Besides slip-resistant shoes, there are a few more critical components to a staff member's uniform when working in the kitchen. Some kitchens prefer that their staff wear hats or hairnets. This is practiced to prevent hair from falling into the customers' food as it is being prepared. Additionally, hair falling into food without notice may cost the establishment revenue in food waste as the meal will likely have to be re-prepared, and potential customers may be warded off through negative online reviews. 
Another industry standard is to ban kitchen staff from wearing watches or jewelry. Personal attire such as these can possibly bring unwanted bacteria into the kitchen and subsequently cause the customer to be served a harmful meal. Although not required in all kitchens, most kitchen uniforms necessitate an apron to protect the wearer from having grease, grime, or other things soil their actual restaurant uniform below.

For example, it would be necessary to keep small buns on hand, for kids’ meal burgers (including both the cheese and plain varieties), and other small sandwiches such as the fish or the chicken. You would also need to keep the next largest set of buns on hand, in case someone orders one of the bigger burgers or sandwiches. Similarly, you would need to keep artisan buns readily available in case of an order for a specialty sandwich. It may also be necessary to keep sub and hoagie rolls fully stocked as well, if your establishment offers such varieties of sandwich.

"Employees typically fall into two categories, sellers and merch. Sellers are constantly on the floor approaching customer and asking them what they need. They float around looking for “targets.” It sounds harsh, but they have to make a certain amount of money per hour. They typically get the most dressed up and have a huge client base. They are never still. They are always running around, trying to find new clients, and they are good at what they do. It is amazing to see them in action. On the other side of the equation is “merch,” short for merchandise. These are the people who directly handle the merchandise. They restock shelves, fix bra displays, and also sell merchandise to customers. They do a bit of everything in the store. Working with merchandise can get overwhelming, because you are expected to do so much, while still making sure that your table is in order. It really is the best job for multi-taskers. Both categories can be exhausting, but fulfilling. If you are more outgoing and goal-oriented, you should sell on the floor. If you are more into organization and selling on your own terms then choose merch. Each job comes with its own set of challenges, but they are both rewarding","Employees typically fall into two categories, sellers and merch. The first type of employee we will talk about is the seller. Now, sellers are constantly on the floor approaching customer and asking them what they need. A seller can not wait for a customer to approach them. They float around looking for “targets.” It sounds harsh, but they have to make a certain amount of money per hour. After all, sellers earn their money off of commission, so it is important to get a client. They typically get the most dressed up and have a huge client base. Since they are the first impression of the company and product, a seller can not appear slovenly or uncaring in appearance. They are never still. They are always running around, trying to find new clients, and they are good at what they do. It is amazing to see them in action. Sellers are the parts of a business that provide motion.
On the other side of the equation is “merch,” short for merchandise. These are the people who directly handle the merchandise. They are responsible for making sure everything is organized. They restock shelves, fix bra displays, and also, though not their primary role, will sometimes sell merchandise to customers if there are no sells person around. Merch maintains the look of the store. They make sure every product is displayed correctly and placed in its proper station. They do a bit of everything in the store.

You will have specific task and always meeting new people. On the other hand, if you are more into organization and selling on your own terms then choose merch. This way you will be performing a multitude of different tasks besides the repetitive nature of sells.

The idea is to not set appointments for residents unless we need to. Most of the time, you’ll find yourself with a pleasant resident, who is understanding, but there are times you’ll be faced with a resident who doesn’t understand and will wish to just set an appointment. Remember to always be calm and polite, and understand that residents almost never want to be calling in; we’re their last and final hope.","Greetings. I am thankful that you are investing your time in reading this. Today, I will show you how you can offer troubleshooting assistance to a resident over the phone.

That being said, we aim not to create an appointment for a resident unless it is deemed to be necessary. 
Throughout the majority of your experience, you will engage with pleasant residents who are empathetic and understanding. However, there will be times when you encounter a resident who does not understand and will want to make an appointment. Though they may be communicating how they feel with frustration, we ask that you do not reciprocate their tone back at them. Remember to always react with politeness and in a calm fashion. This manner can be conveyed if you utilize the strategy of attempting to smile through the phone. Often, a positive attitude is contagious and will influence the course of the conversation.

"An example of this is as follows: Imagine a customer is on a two-part rate and used 1000 kWh on average during the time period, so that is their baseline.  Prior to the time period, the customer receives notification that the marginal rate is $2/kWh because of a flood at the generation site. The standard rate is $0.15/kWh, so they will pay $0.15 * 1000, or $15 for the base rate. But then anything over that amount gets very expensive ($2/kWh), so they will not want any additional usage. (For example, if they added an assembly line, it could cost them thousands to run it.) But if they shut down totally and are in a two-part rate that provides rebates, they will then get a credit of almost $2000 for that period! This can really hurt the provider, as now they have overpriced the usage and have excess usage available that may go unpaid for.","A perfect example of this is elaborated as follows: Imagine there is a customer who is on a two-part rate and used 1000 kWh on average during a certain time period, so you can consider that their baseline. Prior to the time period, the customer receives a notification that the marginal rate is $2/kWh because of some unforeseen circumstances, maybe because of a flood at the generation site. Because the standard rate is $0.15/kWh, the customer will have to pay $0.15 * 1000, or $15, for the base rate. And then anything over that amount gets very expensive ($2/kWh), so it is natural that they will not want any additional usage as it would jeopardize their budget. Take, for example, if they added an additional assembly line and it would cost them thousands to run it, then no one would like to go for that extra cost. This creates an incentive for the customer to substantially reduce their usage to avoid paying the higher marginal rate. But if they go on to shut down totally and are in a two-part rate that provides rebates, they will then get a credit of almost $2000 for that period! That would be super beneficial for the customer. But on the other hand, this can really hurt the provider, as now they have overpriced the usage and have excess usage available that may go unpaid for. This puts the provider in a difficult and uncertain position. This example effectively shows how this kind of pricing system can impact or lead to unexpected outcomes for both customers and their providers. It is evident that for customers, it can create a situation where it is more expensive to increase usage, and on the other hand, for providers, it can result in lost revenue if customers reduce their consumption or shut down completely in order to receive rebates.",Expand on the impact of two-part rate for the customer and the provider,elaborate
"Designing flooring layouts is fun and easy to do in AutoCAD and Adobe Illustrator. You first need to know what the client is looking for in the design. We design based on the theming they want in the area, as well as with budget constraints in mind. They often have different needs for their designs, and our tiles are cut based on those needs. The simplest designs are all squares, followed by designs that are half-squares, or triangles. More complex designs involve die-cut objects or laser-cut objects. Some designs are also cut by hand on-site. Once you know what sort of design the client would like, you can begin.","Designing different flooring layouts can be remarkably simple and even enjoyable to do in AutoCAD and Adobe Illustrator. The first thing you will need to know is what the client is hoping to see in the design. Our designs take into account the theme that the client desires for an area, as well as any of the project’s budget constraints. Budget constraints are an important consideration in every project, since they may affect every step of the cutting process, determining everything from design size and complexity to material selection. Clients often have very different needs for their designs, and we must cut all of our tiles according to those individual needs. Some clients have spartan needs, requiring only the simplest of floor plans at the most economical prices available, while others come to us with purely aesthetic concerns, desiring the most elegant options available in material and design. Most clients’ wishes fall somewhere between these two extremes, and it is important for us to discover exactly where on the spectrum they lie.  The very simplest of designs are squares, closely followed by half-squares, or triangles if you prefer. More complex designs require the use of die-cut objects or laser-cut objects. A few designs are even cut by hand, in an artisanal manner on-site. As previously mentioned, the first step is to find out what kind of design the client has in mind, only after that can we begin to prepare whatever tools and materials are necessary to cut the design. ",Elaborate on the considerations that need to be taken during the floorplan design process.,elaborate
"There are various types of identity which show how a person fits into different situations. A personal identity is developed from our self-concept, how we perceive ourselves. This can be influenced by any number of things; however, it primarily consists of our current self and our idealised self. There is an observable self that is close to our true self, consisting of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours; however, the behaviours do not always align with thoughts and feelings. This is called cognitive dissonance, where our thoughts and actions aren’t in tune—our actions do not represent our feelings or vice versa. For us to change into our idealised selves, we must change either the actions or the feelings.","There is a multitude of identities that display how a person fits into differing situations. Personal identity is established four our self-concept, which is how we perceive ourselves. The perception of ourselves is subject to influence by numerous things. Various factors, including genetics, upbringing, culture, experiences, relationships, and society, shape our sense of self.
Our personality traits are influenced by genetics, affecting our self-concept. Our sense of self is also shaped by our upbringing and family relationships, as they provide our earliest and most significant socialization experiences. Additionally, culture and society impact our self-concept through the values, beliefs, and norms we internalize. At the same time, the media, including social media, can present idealized standards of beauty, success, and happiness that influence our sense of self. Our experiences, both positive and negative, can shape our self-concept, with negative feedback or traumatic events leading to low self-esteem and a negative self-concept.
On the other hand, positive experiences and feedback can enhance our self-esteem and self-concept. Our relationships with others play a significant role in shaping our sense of self. Our interactions with family, friends, romantic partners, and colleagues can impact how we see ourselves and our place in the world.

"The next step to remember is that when you hear a siren, you must press the response buttons. There are two buttons: one on the front and one on the back. They must be pressed and released at the same time to be effective. The patient has approximately forty-five seconds to do so before treatment is administered. A siren indicates that an undesirable rhythm has been identified by the system that would warrant a treatment or shock to correct the arrhythmia. However, if an arrhythmia occurs, more than 95% of people become unconscious due to inadequate blood flow to the brain. If you are awake and alert, it is unlikely that an arrhythmia is occurring. Pushing the response buttons simultaneously will delay treatment. Some people get confused and wonder why they would delay a treatment if the monitor seems to indicate that something is wrong. It’s important for people to remember that there are other things that would cause the monitor’s alarm to go off  besides a fatal arrhythmia, including loose electrodes that are not making good contact with the skin. In these instances, treatment is not required. Always remember, if you hear a siren, press the response buttons. If you are not aware of the siren because you are unconscious, treatment is required and will be administered by the LifeVest.","The step to recall is that once you catch the siren's blare, you must hit the response buttons: the one in the front and the one in the back. They must be pushed and let go of at the exact time to work correctly. The patient has around forty-five seconds to perform this action before treatment is given. The LifeVest monitor reads your electrocardiogram (EKG) continuously. An EKG is a line graph that shows changes in the heart's electrical activity over time. An instrument makes it called an electrocardiograph. 
Suppose you have ventricular tachycardia (which is a rapid heartbeat) or ventricular fibrillation (which is a fast, uncontrolled, weak heartbeat). In that case, the device sounds an alarm to validate if you can respond. The vest's primary function is to monitor heart rate and discover when an irregular rhythm occurs. The stated treatment is to restore the heartbeat to a regular pace through a series of shocks. A siren signals that an unwanted rhythm has been discovered in the system that would call for treatment to rectify the arrhythmia. 
Arrhythmia is more commonly known as an irregular heartbeat. It may occur if the heart beats too quickly or slowly or has an unusual rhythm. The primary causes are narrowed heart arteries, heart attack, abnormal heart valves, reactions from previous heart surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and other heart damage. 
Of course, if an arrhythmia does happen, over 95% of people will go unconscious because insufficient blood goes to the brain. If you are conscious and aware, no arrhythmia is probably taking place. Pressing the response buttons at the same time will postpone treatment. Some people get puzzled by this and ponder why treatment should be delayed if the monitor shows something is amiss. People need to recall that numerous things might set the alarm off and not just a fatal arrhythmia, such as loose electrodes that do not have a suitable attachment to the skin. In cases like this, treatment is not necessary. If you catch the siren's blare, hit the response buttons. If you do not notice the siren since you have lost consciousness, treatment is needed and will be given by LifeVest. After the shock, if your heartbeat returns to normal, the alarms stop, and LifeVest returns to its normal monitoring mode.
However, the treatment cycle repeats if your heartbeat doesn't return to normal and the arrhythmia continues. You can get up to five treatment shocks. If you are concerned about how long the LifeVest can offer support to you, clients have worn a LifeVest for as long as about seven years. However, many people just wear them for a few weeks or a few months.

"Also known as Scrum, agile development is a form of project management used to develop products. This methodology is different from the standard methodology, which is waterfall. In waterfall, there is a “gate 2” at the start (and end) of each development phase. The various phases in waterfall are requirements gathering, testing, development (programming), and deployment. In contrast to Agile, waterfall doesn’t not have rollbacks.: Once a stage is complete, there is no way of modifying it. That has frequently been considered a disadvantage. On the other hand, in Agile, there are multiple iterations during which one can mouify requirements. The goal of Agile is to develop a deployable application by the end of every iteration (also called a “sprint”). Each sprint is usually comprised of a two week period. In Agile(which is also known as Scrum), there is a constant feedback loop. The principles of Agile development can be found in the Agile Manifesto which is found online.  The sifferent Agile methodologies are: Scrum (most popular), Scrum illustration, Scrum roles, Scrum ceremonies, Scrum (daily), sprint demo, and Scrum artifacts. When does one use Agile over waterfall? When one has to quickly develop a project in a domain where there is already a lot of work done. In comparison, waterfall can be used whenit’s actually the other way around. Another type of agile development is Lean (LEAN), which commonly uses Kanban boards. These are boards that have different stages (like To Do, In Progress, Done), and everyone is assigned to that project, to a certain task. In Agile there is also what is called retrospectives, which are a way to keep the team up to date with what has been done. In Retros, as they are commonly called, there are many different methods to do this. For example, a common method is to use Post-it notes to create three categories: mad, sad, glad. very person has to write a few things they are mad/sad/glad about, then the master of ceremonies tells everyone to put the notes up on the board and he groups the common topics together. Then there is a round of voting, which is done by the “dots” method, in which everyone gets two to three dots. They vote on one of the topics, then the Scrum master of ceremonies writes or discusses the topics in order of priority. Another commonly done thing is the “ball” method, which works by giving a ball to someone in the team,then only the person that holds the ball can talk about the problems or events in the team. The other team members can ask for the ball by having their hand raised, and the ball is passed in a circle to the person on the right or just by selecting someone with their hand up. Retros are good because they help analyse the outcome of a sprint. They also help to prioritize important topics. This is called timeboxing. Teams can often get bored of doing the same Retro method every week, so the team has to keep the Retro method fresh every week, or every two weeks. Agile is commonly used for test-driven development, Test-driven development is a way of developing by writing tests before you write any code. When the code is compiled, the tests are run against it, and you know which tests run and which don’t, which gives a good idea of how to do the test. In Java, a common thing to use to write tests is called JUnit, and there are four versions.JUnit 4 is the most commonly used one at the moment. Other tools are like Docker and Mockito help with writing mock tests. For example, you need a database and  you don’t actually have a database, but you have some code that uses a database. You can create a mock of the database without actually making a database, because making databases is very tedious, That’s an example. Another example is using coded completion in IDEs. This is done by scanning the libraries of the programming language. Test-driven development is also used to keep track of good code in Git or Git-like programs, because every time someone commits, the tests are passed, and you can see who commited what and if it runs or not. An advantage of this, which is called continuous integration, is that when you are commiting code at least daily, you can always have the option to rollback to the last version of the program that was properly running. Other examples of Git-like programs are Jenkins and Bamboo. Do note that Git is for GitLab and GitHub. They are not different versions of Git, they are just web portals that belong to different companies, but they still use Git on the backend. When one comes across Agile and Git, one is also taught all about web services and REST. REST is a universal API standard which tells programs how to transmit things so that they are standardised. For example, JSON is a very global form of transmitting data. Virtually any modern programming language uses JSON to transfer data between different environments, like between a web server and a Java server. APIs commonly use JSON to transfer data, like Twilio, which uses services to send SMs to carriers all over the world, but one does not have to see their code implementation. The whole idea behind APIs is that you can just call universal functions, and they will handle everything else.In the case of Twilio, you can just call a function that gets sent to them with a country code, phone number and a message to be sent.hey will handle all the code details about how to get the message sent to a specific country, and take into account all of the carriers that are available. APIs are the statement that models, “Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.”","Also known by the name of Scrum, agile development is a form of project management that is used to aid in the development of different products. This methodology is a bit different from the standard methodology, which is known as “waterfall”. Waterfall has long been seen as the standard model of project management, particularly in engineering projects such as with software development. This methodology focuses on preparation and information gathering by carefully preparing as much data about the project as possible and methodically constructing a concrete set of goals aimed at accomplishing the project’s goals. The steps to be undertaken are thus constructed as a series of independent cells, with the advent of one depending on the completion of the one before. In this system each step must be conducted in a completely linear order, and entirely independent of one another, with absolutely no way of returning to stages once they have been completed.  In waterfall, there is a “gate 2” at the start (and the end) of each development phase. The various phases in waterfall are the requirements for gathering, testing, development (programming), and deployment of the products. One of the primary contrasts between waterfall and Agile is that waterfall does not make use of rollbacks. That is to reiterate that once a stage is complete, there is no way of going back and modifying it later. That fact has frequently been brought up as a significant disadvantage of waterfall. On the other hand, in Agile, there are multiple iterations during which one has the ability to modify the requirements. The goal of Agile is to develop a deployable application by the end of every iteration (iterations are also called “sprints” sometimes). Usually, each of these sprints will consist of a two week period. In Agile (which I feel the need to remind you is also referred to as “Scrum” on occasion), there is a constant feedback loop present. 
The principles of Agile development can also be found in the Agile Manifesto, a work which was created in early 2001 through the combined efforts of many leading thinkers in the field of software development, including representatives from reputable institutions in the field such as Xtreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, and Pragmatic Programming.The Agile Manifesto can be found online, and its message can be essentially boiled down to call for a shifting away from traditional corporate values and towards ones that place greater emphasis on the importance and needs of the employees as individuals throughout the development process. There are many different Agile methodologies, some of which include: Scrum (which is the most popular option), Scrum illustration, Scrum roles, Scrum ceremonies, Scrum (daily), sprint demo, and Scrum artifacts. 
One might wonder when they should use Agile over waterfall? Usually, one should choose Agile when one has to quickly develop a project in a domain where quite a bit of work has already been done. In comparison, waterfall is most often used when the situation is turned the other way around, and very little previous work is available to aid in the development of the current project. Another type of Agile development is Lean (LEAN), which is commonly known for making use of Kanban boards. Kanban boards are boards that have different stages upon them, such as “To Do, In Progress, Done”. Each team member then receives an assignment to that project, and further to a certain task falling underneath the project’s umbrella. In Agile there is also another management tool that is commonly known as “retrospectives”. Retrospectives are a way to keep the team up to date with what tasks have been accomplished. Retrospectives are also commonly referred to as “Retros” and they usually consist of conducting some style of team debriefing after the completion of a sprint (remember that this term refers to period of work lasting around two weeks) in order to unpack all of the things that went well and all of the things that did not during that time.
 There are many different methods available to engage in Retros. For example, one particularly common method is to use Post-it notes to create three categories: mad, sad, glad. Each and every team member is then expected to write up a few things about which they are feeling mad/sad/glad, then the master of ceremonies instructs the group to place their notes up on the board. He then rearranges them upon the board, grouping the common topics together. After that little bit of reshuffling the team holds a round of voting, which is carried out by utilizing the “dots” method. The dots method is a collective decision making in which everyone receives two to three dots with which to vote on one of the topics. In this way the results of the vote end up not unlike those of a multiple-choice survey conducted amongst team members. After the voting process has been completed the Scrum master of ceremonies writes or discusses the topics in order of elected priority. Another commonly performed method of Retros is referred to as the “ball” method, a process which functions via the giving of a ball to someone in the team. Once the ball has been delivered, only the person that is currently holding the ball has the right to talk about the problems or events in the team. The other team members can ask to receive the ball by raising their hands, at which point the ball is to be passed along, either in a circle with each person passing the ball to the person on their right, or simply by selecting the individual who raised their hand to be the next speaker. 
Retros are important parts of the Agile development process because they help teams analyze the outcome of a sprint. They can also help to prioritize important topics. This is a process called timeboxing. Oftentimes, teams can quickly grow bored of doing the same Retro method every week, so the team is encouraged to keep the Retro method fresh every week, or at least every two weeks. Agile is commonly used for test-driven development. Test-driven development is a way of developing by writing the tests before you actually write any code. When the code is compiled, the tests are run against it, and you will then find out which tests run and which do not, which gives a good starting point for ideas of how to do the test. In Java, it is not an uncommon thing to write tests called JUnits, of which there are four different versions. JUnit 4 is the most commonly used one at the present moment. Other tools, such as Docker and Mockito, can help you with the writing of mock tests. For example, you may be in need of a database. Perhaps you do not actually have a database, but you do have some code that uses a database. You can then create a mock of the database without actually making a database, which can be very useful because making databases can become extremely tedious. That is but one example. Another example is the use of coded completion in IDEs. This is accomplished through scanning the libraries of the programming language itself. Test-driven development can also be used to keep track of good code in Git or Git-like programs. This is because every time someone commits, the tests are passed, and you can then see who committed what and if it will run or not. Another advantage of this is something which is called continuous integration. This is when you are commiting code at least once a day, and thus if a program suddenly stops running, you can always have the option to rollback to the last version of the program from when it  was properly running. Other notable examples of Git-like programs are Jenkins and Bamboo. It is important to note that Git is to be used for GitLab and GitHub. They are not different versions of Git themselves, they are just web portals that belong to different companies, but they both still use Git on the backend. When one comes across Agile and Git, one is also taught all about web services and REST. REST is a universal application programming interface (API) standard which gives programs the instructions that they need to know in order to transmit things in a manner that maintains their standardization. For example, JSON is a very global form of transmitting data. Virtually any modern programming language uses JSON as a method of transferring data between different environments, such as between a web server and a Java server. APIs commonly use JSON to transfer data, such as Twilio, which uses services to send SMs to carriers all over the world, but does not necessarily have to keep their code implementation visible to do so. The whole idea behind APIs is that you can just call in universal functions, and they will handle everything else. In the case of Twilio, for instance, you can just call down a function that gets sent to them with a country code, phone number and whatever message is to be sent. The APIs are capable of handling all the code details having to do with getting the message sent to a specific country, and can also take into account all of the carriers that are available for you. APIs are the statement that models the old adage, “Do not try to reinvent the wheel.”",Flesh out more information about Agile methodology,elaborate

"Today, I will be talking about the trip I took to London with my three other friends. At first we decided how to get there without having to pay anything at all. We researched the cheapest price to get to London and back without using any expensive public transports, such as the train or a national express bus. Our aim was to get the transport as low as ten dollars per person round-trip. Finally, we decided to meet at my home and research into the transport. After that, we had a talk about how to plan the journey back to London. It was three of my friends and myself. It was a perfect getaway after all the coursework and exams at the end of the first semester of my master’s program. Finally, we decided to take Megabus to  Victoria Coach Station in London. We found cheap tickets as low as five dollars for a single ticket per person and, for a return, four dollars per person. We were happy with this decision to go to London using Megabus. The bus stop is close to my home, approximately a fifteen-minute walk away. After that, we discussed what type of activities we should go for. For example, which museums should we visit? My friends have never seen the London Eye or other famous London areas. So we asked Google for a quick tips on how to get the best service we can on our journey. After that, we found the five top places to visit in London, which are the London Eye, a few other good museums, and some parks. So we settled in and went for an early night’s rest because our itinerary started at 6 a.m. We would get to London within two hours. From there, we went straight to the nearest food chain where we could get some good-quality breakfast for a good price. We went to some local London cafe where we had coffee and some other snacks. After that, we went for a walk to Buckingham Palace. It took fifteen to thirty-five minutes of walking, with several stops along the way to look around on the way to the Palace. From there, we had a look at the Palace. It was incredibly beautiful and we all enjoyed it. We all took several photos at the Palace and shared them across Facebook and Instagram so that our friends back home in Coventry can view them. From there, we had a walk around the Palace and read every quote we could find which highlights the importance of this palace. From there, we had a walk to local places such as Big Ben and had the opportunity to take a picture in front of it. We also took a picture in front of the famous London Eye. Unfortunately, we could not enter the London Eye because it was closed for a week due to repairs. But that didn’t stop us. We took several pictures of the London Eye and we all moved on. By then, we had walked about five miles and we were all tired. So we decided to get some good fast food. We met at a local London Chinese food place that specializes in noodles. We liked the place, but not the price. At that moment, a single package of noodles cost eight dollars and extra 2.50 for a drink. So we had a talk and we all decided to capitalize on this fabulous offer. Then, we all ordered three different varieties of noodles from this shop. One friend ordered a vegetarian option, another friend ordered chicken and beer, and I ordered chicken, pork, and beef with a Coca-Cola along with it. We paid approximately around twelve dollars each. We were not happy with the price we paid, but we figured it was for the experience. It took us a good forty minutes to finish the food. Two of my friends couldn’t finish the food due to excess food and if was covered in oil and little bit spicy. So I ate their food, too, except for the vegetarian option because I prefer meat. Then, we went past several other stops, such as museums. One of the museums we went to is called the British History Museum. It was huge in size and we all liked the entrance. In the entrance there was a guy selling beautiful old-style cashew nuts, which we all bought since they only cost two dollars per pack. From there, we went inside the museum and it was beautifully designed. We all liked it and its diverse range of collections. We all went our separate ways. I went to the Egyptian collection, my friend went to the African collection and another friend went to the Asian collection. It took a good three hours for us to meet up after the museum, but it was worth it and we all liked it. We all had a rest and came up with the idea to just to see a local movie for a while before we figure out what to do next. Then, we carried on moving and going to places that seemed interesting to us so that we could take good pictures and move on. From there, we went to a different theater or museum that was showing an  art collection. It was a great art collection and we all liked it. And it only took us twenty minutes to view this art collection because of its boring acts. We didn’t like it and we moved on walking to the other parts of thestreet. It was great, but the day was getting short. We all want to go to KFC to find good food for a bargain. From there, we waited for a bus service . It took us a good twenty minutes to get to the nearest KFC restaurant. We liked it.","Today, I shall be sharing about the wonderful trip I took to visit London, the capital of England and the United Kingdom, with my three other friends. At first, we discussed ways and means to get there without having to pay much and researched to find cost-effective solutions. First of all, we tried to find the cheapest price to get to London and return without using any costly public transport, such as the train or a national express bus. We aimed to get the transportation cost as low as ten dollars per person round-trip, which seems quite implausible, but we were determined to do it. To achieve our aim of visiting London at an extremely low price, we decided to meet at my home and research the transport facilities available to visit the beautiful city. After that, we talked about how to plan the journey back to London. We were a group of four friends, and it felt like a perfect getaway after all the tedious coursework and long exams at the end of the first semester of my Master's program. After a lot of discussions, we finally made up our minds and decided to take the Megabus to Victoria Coach Station in London. It was amazing that we managed to find cheap tickets for as little as five dollars for a single ticket per person, and for a return ticket, it was four dollars per person. We were all happy and on the same page with this decision about going to London on a Megabus. The bus stop is not far from my home; it is approximately a fifteen-minute walk away. So it was very convenient to walk to the bus stop. After finalizing the means of transport, we discussed what types of activities and famous places we should go to. For example, we talked about which are the best museums we should visit and what attractions we could cover within our budget. My friends have never seen the iconic London Eye, the Millennium Wheel, which is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London or other world-famous London areas. So, we took help from Google and asked for quick information on how to get the best service and facilities we can during our journey. After that, we identified the top five places to visit in London, which included the famous London Eye, some must-visit museums, and picturesque parks. To ensure that we had a fresh start, we decided to call it a night early. So we settled in and went to sleep because our itinerary started at 6 a.m. We estimated that we would get to London within the next two hours. The next day, we followed our itinerary. 
After reaching London, we went straight to the nearest food chain where we could get some super-good-quality breakfast without breaking the bank. We headed to a local London cafe, where we had a morning coffee and some other tasty snacks. Soon after that, our plan was to visit Buckingham Palace. It is a royal residence in London and the administrative headquarters of the sovereign of the United Kingdom. The palace is located in the City of Westminster, and is often at the center of state events and royal hospitality. So, we went there on foot. It took about fifteen to thirty-five minutes of walking, with many stops along the way to take in the picturesque sights on the way to the palace. Once we reached there, we had a look at the famous palace. It looked exceptionally beautiful, and we all enjoyed observing it. We all took several photos at the Palace from various angles and shared them across our social media accounts like Facebook and Instagram so that our friends back home in Coventry could view them and share in our excitement. We took a long and slow walk around the palace and read every quote or text we could find that gave information about the importance of that amazing palace. After that, we walked to all the nearby local places, such as Big Ben, and took the opportunity to take a picture in front of it. Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the Great Clock of Westminster and is a famous tourist spot. You will find visitors from all over the world visiting the place throughout the year. We also took a picture in front of the iconic London Eye. We wanted to enter the popular attraction, but unluckily, we could not enter the London Eye because it was shut for a week due to restorations. It was disappointing, but we did not allow this setback to dampen our spirit, and it did not stop us from having fun. We took many pictures of the London Eye, and we all moved on since we had to visit other famous tourist spots. By this time, all of us had walked about five miles, and we were all feeling exhausted and hungry. So we decided to find some nice fast food and get it. We all went to a local London Chinese food place that specializes in noodles. The food was delicious, but it was overpriced. So, we liked the place but not the price. At the food joint, a single box of noodles costs eight dollars, and you have to pay an extra $2.50 for a drink. 
We thought of making the best use of this visit. So we all discussed and decided to capitalize on an incredible offer. We each ordered a different type of noodle dish: my friend chose the vegetarian option, while another went for chicken and beer. I opted for a combination of chicken, pork, and beef and a refreshing Coca-Cola to go with it. We paid approximately twelve dollars each for the food. We were not happy with the cost, but we felt it was okay for the experience. It took us about forty minutes to finish the food because the portion size was huge. Two of my friends could not finish the food due to the extra-large portion size and the fact that the food was covered in oil and a little bit spicy. As a meat lover, I could not let the meat go to waste, so I offered to finish it for them. The only dish I did not touch was the vegetarian option, as I prefer meat. Despite the slightly steep prices, we enjoyed the experience and savored every bite. After finishing our meals, we continued with our itinerary.
We went past so many other incredible stops that had some great stuff to offer, and we also saw wonderful attractions such as some excellent museums. One of the museums that we went to is known as the British History Museum, which is a public museum dedicated to human history, art, and culture. It was massive in its size, and we were all impressed by the entrance. At the entry gate, there was a guy selling tasty cashew nuts, which we all bought since they only cost two dollars per pack. From there, we went inside the museum, which was beautifully designed. We were in awe of the stunning designs and the diverse range of collections from all over the world. We all liked it and went our separate ways to explore further. After splitting up with my friends, I went to the massive and unique Egyptian collection, while my friend explored the African collection, and another friend checked out the Asian collection. It took us a good three hours to meet up after the museum, but we all agreed that it was well worth it and enjoyed it greatly.
We were all tired by this time, so we all decided to take a break. After taking a break, we chose to catch a local movie at the nearest cinema to pass some time before we made any further plans about where to go next. We continued exploring London and visiting places that caught our interest so we could take good photos and share them with our family and friends, and then we kept moving. From there, we went to another theater or museum that was showing an amazing art collection. Initially, we were skeptical, but it turned out to be a great collection that we all enjoyed. However, we only spent about twenty minutes viewing it because some of the exhibits were quite boring for our taste. We did not like it much, and we moved on, walking to other parts of the street. As the day wore on, we realized that we were running out of time. So, we decided to grab a quick bite at KFC, as it was known for offering delicious food at affordable prices. We waited for the bus service to take us to the nearest KFC outlet, which took us around twenty minutes to reach there. Upon arriving, we ordered our meals and found the food to be satisfying and tasty. We liked it, and it was worth the effort.",Embellish on the writer's experience,elaborate

By doing so, we can produce more products in the same amount of time, resulting in business expansion. Some other advantages of having a partner include bringing in additional skills, knowledge, and expertise that I may not possess, which can help the business grow and expand. 
A partner can share the workload and responsibilities, allowing each of us to focus on our strengths and interests. This can help improve efficiency and productivity and reduce stress and burnout. A partner can provide emotional support and motivation, especially during challenging times, which is natural for small businesses during their onset periods. Also, having a partner can help diversify the business and reduce the risk of failure, as each of us can bring different perspectives and ideas. Overall, having a business partner can be a valuable asset for a small business and help ensure its long-term success. Expanding the company through a partnership will increase our production capacity, allowing us to generate more profits. By working together, the partner can take charge of marketing while I can focus on making more products. Since the company focuses on handmade items, I am the only one who can create our inventory. This will ultimately result in business growth and increased profits, providing a steady income for both of us.
As the business owner, I place a high value on the personalized approach that the business has developed. I ensure that, even after bringing in a partner, the personal and unique touch of the company will remain unchanged. This personal touch refers to how we interact with customers, the level of customization and attention to detail in our products, and customers' overall experience when they interact with the business. Maintaining my touch will help the company stand out and attract customers who appreciate and value this personalized service. By aiming to preserve the personal tone of the business, I aim to ensure that its core values and mission remain intact even as it grows and expands. Despite transitioning to a partnership, I strive to maintain the business's personalized approach.",Elaborate on the dynamics of entering a partnership when running a small business,elaborate
"DNA quantification is set up on the liquid handling robot and read on a fluorometer.  First make sure you have appropriate standards for the assay. These should be aliquoted out and placed in the fridge. We use the 0-100ng standards to ensure all sample concentration ranges are covered. Take out the standards and shake them on a plate shaker while allowing to come to room temperature. Whilst the standards are shaking, prepare the assay buffer. This is made up in a 1:200 ratio of dye to buffer. Add an extra couple of samples to your calculation for pipetting error. Make up this working buffer solution in a reservoir container.  Next get your samples that you want to quantify ready. Make sure they are shaken on the plate shaker or vortexed. Quickly spin down using a centrifuge for thirty seconds. Once all the reagents and samples are ready, you can set up the robot. Once the software has loaded, you must initialise the system. This is found under the menu ‘instrument’ and then ‘home all axis’. The programs will not run without initialising the robot first. If this is not done an error message will come up when you press ‘start’. Once initialised, select the ‘run’ button from the top toolbar. This will bring up a prompt for you to enter how many columns you are doing. Input the number. Next it will ask you to scan in the barcode of the sample plate and quant plate. This information is needed for quality tracking and will be stored in the LIMS system. Next the software will bring up a prompt showing where to place the consumables on the deck. Follow this exactly, because any incorrectly placed consumables will result in a crash and potential loss of samples.","DNA quantification processes are set up on the liquid handling robot and the results are read on a fluorometer.  The first thing you need to do to prepare for such an experiment is to make sure that you have the appropriate standards for the assay. These should then be carefully aliquoted out and placed inside of a refrigerator to cool. We will be using the 0-100ng standards to ensure that all of the sample concentration ranges are covered. After the standards have cooled for some time, you should take them out of the refrigerator and shake them on a plate shaker while allowing them to slowly come back to room temperature. Whilst the standards are shaking, you should begin preparing the assay buffer. This is made up in a 1:200 ratio of dye to buffer, though you should add an extra couple of samples to your calculation to account for possible pipetting errors. You should make up this working buffer solution in a reservoir container to prevent the possibility of cross-contamination or the influence of other unwanted variables from affecting the results of the experiment. After that, it will be time for you to prepare all of the samples that you want to quantify, which means that you will have to make sure they are shaken on the plate shaker or that they get vortexed. 
After all of that has been accomplished, you should give the standards a quick spin down inside of a centrifuge for thirty seconds. Once all the reagents and samples have been prepared in this manner, you can begin setting up the robot for the experiment. This process must begin with uploading the necessary software. Once the software has been loaded, you will have to initialise the system. This program can be found by looking under the menu ‘instrument’ and then searching beneath the subheading ‘home all axis’. None of the robot’s programs will be capable of running unless you initialise the robot first. If the robot has not been initialised, an error message will come up when you press the ‘start’ button. Once the robot has been initialised, you should select the ‘run’ button from the toolbar at the top of the screen. This will in turn bring up a prompt asking for you to enter how many columns you plan on using in your experiment, and you should then input that number. Next it will ask you to scan in the barcode of the sample plate and quant plate. This information is needed for quality tracking purposes and it will be stored in the laboratory information management system (LIMS). After that the software will bring up a prompt showing you where to place the consumables on the deck. It is crucial that you follow these instructions as closely as possible. This is for the simple but critical reasons that any incorrectly placed consumables may result in a system crash which could in turn result in the potential loss of the samples. Such a failure is intolerable not only because it wastes valuable laboratory equipment and time, but also because it is extremely embarrassing. As always it will be very important for you to clean up after the results of the experiment have been dutifully logged. This process not only includes utilizing the proper cleaning techniques and disposal techniques for each of the different chemicals involved in the experiment (according to each of their appropriate safety guidelines), but also by following the proper cleaning processes and by replacing all equipment and instruments that were utilized during the process. ",Elaborate on all of the neccesary steps to be undertaken when performing a DNA quantification experiment.,elaborate
"Of course with marketing, getting the message across is key. We work with Google Ads and social media, and use Buzzfeed-type articles, which work very well for us to create those viral articles that reach millions. It is all about shareability, teaching something new and creating those moments that people remember. With offices around the world, we are close to the tech boom in San Francisco and growing more in Los Angeles, with contacts at Google, Buzzfeed, Snapchat, and more.

"When writing a paper, it is imperative to have a centralized focus, or thesis statement. Your thesis statement should be only a sentence or two. It should not be any longer than this. The goal of your thesis statement should be to present an argument and support the main point of your paper. The thesis statement should also be the last sentence of your introduction.","An excellent paper details or argues a topic or idea. Establishing the aim of the piece early is critical to its success. After the research is completed and it is time to write the paper, it is essential to present a centralized focus in the form of a thesis statement. The thesis should be given as only one to two sentences. If the idea you are wanting to convey requires additional sentences, then it is likely your idea is too complex and it needs to be rendered down. 
A thesis's primary function is to present and support your paper's dominant focal point. Therefore, it aids in controlling the paper's ideas as they are later expounded. The thesis statement should be provided in the concluding portion of the introductory paragraph. A strong thesis is comprehensible and clearly outlines a path for the reader to follow.",Elaborate on thesis development.,elaborate
"Along with these two references, we also request that you create a style sheet. A style sheet is a list of words that are capitalized, hyphenated, or otherwise spelled differently. The style sheet can also include a basic list of general grammar or syntax decisions that you have chosen to implement in the manuscript. For instance, the style sheet might include a note about using serial commas, along with the correct spelling of Kunotambo (instead of Kuno Tambo). Please note that the style sheet should be alphabetized. If you need an example of a style sheet, please don't hesitate to contact the managing editor.","In addition to the two previously mentioned references, we also request that you make a style sheet. A style sheet depicts a list of words that are capitalized, hyphenated, or potentially spelled differently than they traditionally would be. It acts as a guide, ensuring that you maintain a consistent voice throughout the work. If the language is not uniform throughout the entirety of the work, the piece will suffer and potentially lose the confidence of the audience. Style sheets are a keen tool to use when endeavoring to deliver high-caliber work. The style sheet can also have a rudimentary catalog of general grammar or syntax choices that you have decided to implement into your manuscript. For example, the style sheet might feature a note about utilizing serial commas and also present the correct spelling of Kunotambo (instead of Kuno Tambo).
Another example will be if you have a preference to spell out dates rather than write them numerically (Today is February fourteenth instead of 02/14). Please be aware that the style sheet is required to be alphabetized. An organized style sheet improves productivity and, ultimately, the product itself.

"For this document, I am going to explain how to complete all of the daily tasks for my job as a digital producer for a publishing-related magazine and website. These instructions should allow someone to fill in for me, and do my job when I am out of the office. Twice weekly, it is my job to compile and publish a newsletter that is then sent to around 30,000 opt-in subscribers. “Opt in” means that all of our subscribers manually signed up for the newsletter through our website, and they are not being sent any content they didn’t subscribe to. One of the first things I do when I come in is to look through my email and Dropbox and see who has sent me articles and images. Each week, the newsletter contains some custom or new content, as well as content from the website and digitized versions of the print articles. Often the print articles need to be digitized by me. This is usually the easiest task to accomplish because the articles are already proofed and have already been published. So I don’t need to wait for anyone to respond to me or to get me assets. Each week, you can access the newsletter outline in our shared drive on the company network. It will tell you what articles are going into the newsletter, as well as which authors are being featured in the section which highlights book deals from that week. It also contains some information about the advertisements and various articles which will be linked on the side of the newsletter but not featured. These are typically older articles that were popular, or some recurring features like reviews of the week, and the bestseller lists. After you have gone through your email and Dropbox, and you have downloaded any content that you received from the editors, you should save all of the assets in individual folders inside the newsletter folder on the shared drive. It is important to never modify the original file in case we need it in the future. To that end, I find it is best to create a subfolder in each article folder called “originals”. This is where I store all the original files. Once articles have been approved, you can begin adding them to the newsletter template in the CMS. There are links to the CMS pages on your desktop. Once you get into the CMS you can create a new article by pushing the New Article button. Each article needs to have four headlines. The headlines are for web, print, newsletter, and subscription. They are usually all the same headline, but the article won’t publish correctly without all four filled in. It is also important to choose a category for the article. Since the newsletter is children’s-themed, you always want to choose the options under “children’s”. If it is an interview or profile, you should choose the option “Author”. If it is related to bookselling news you should choose that category. Bookselling news is anything like a trade fair, book fair, author convention, events and so forth. This category also includes anything that is related to a book deal. So this will include the book deals article. The “Books” category is pretty self-explanatory, this refers to any article of book round-ups, reviews, and the like. It’s usually pretty easy to tell if something is book news or author news, but if you feel confused you can ask someone. We also have the category “Common Core”. This comes up pretty rarely but is, as the name suggests, about the Common Core. After you choose the category, you can copy and paste the article into the article content box. Often, formatting doesn’t carry over properly so it is important to check and make sure all the italics and things copy over. It is also important to check any hyperlinks that might be in the story. Next, you need to create a blurb for the story. This is usually the first few sentences of the article, but sometimes if the article is less ‘newsy’ it is just a summary of the articles contents. For instance, you don’t want to lead off a profile with a quote as the blurb, even though a quote is often the first thing in the blurb. When formatting interviews, it is important to put the questions that the interviewer asks in bold/blue and the intro above the interview in italics. After that, you can save the article and hit “Preview.” Make sure everything looks good then go back into the article page on the CMS and add any photos. To add photos, scroll down and click “Add Media”. The photos shouldn’t be any wider than 600 pixels. The photo in the first position is always the photo that shows up on the preview. To actually make the images appear in the article, you add the tag [photo NAMEOFPHOTO width=”600”]. You can make the width smaller if you don’t want it to stretch the entire width of the article page. You can also add captions below the image. Again check the preview link. If it looks good, you can then go to the newsletter CMS page and add the article. You should also add a small preview image. We crop preview images in a 5x4 ratio for consistency. Once all of the articles have been proofread and added, and once they are in the template, you should check the newsletter preview. Make sure the blurbs make sense and that they haven’t been cut off. Make sure the images are clear and not pixelated, and that they are consistently sized. It is also crucial to make sure that none of the advertisements conflict with the stories. The marketing team will add the ads in (but make sure they work) yet it is important that we aren’t running an article about a new book that is being advertised in the issue. It looks like a conflict of interest. If there is an ad for something we have an article about, we can always just hold the article until next week. Once you have everything proofed, send the link to the children’s editor and she will check it out. If there any changes are  needed, she will let you know. Once any final changes have been made, you can send the CMS link to the digital team and they will send it out. Always try to send out the newsletter by 5:00 PM EST.","For this document, I am going to explain how to complete all of the daily tasks for my job as a digital producer for a publishing-related magazine and website. I am creating these instructions so that, if I am away from the office or unavailable to complete these tasks for any reason, someone else can fill in for me. Twice a week, it is my job to compile and publish a newsletter that is then sent to around 30,000 opt-in subscribers. “Opt in” means that all of our subscribers manually signed up for the newsletter through our website, and they are not being sent any content they didn’t subscribe to. Therefore, you have provide a quality newsletter since people are actively subscribing to it. One of the first things I do when I come in is to look through my email and Dropbox so that I can see who has sent me articles and images. You do not have to search for the articles for yourself, because they will be provided. Each week, the newsletter contains some custom or new content, as well as content from the website and digitized versions of the print articles. Often the print articles need to be digitized by me. This is usually the easiest task to accomplish because the articles are already proof read and have already been published. So I don’t need to wait for anyone to respond to me or to get me assets. This makes the process more streamlined and allows you to work on your schedule without having to worry about someone else’s getting in the way.

It also contains some information about the advertisements and various articles which will be linked on the side of the newsletter but not featured. These are typically older articles that were popular, or some recurring features like reviews of the week, and the bestseller lists. Everything you will need to create the newsletter is in those two places. After you have gone through your email and Dropbox, and you have downloaded any content that you received from the editors, you should save all of the assets in individual folders inside the newsletter folder on the shared drive. It is important to never modify the original file in case we need it in the future. 
To that end, I find it is best to create a subfolder in each article folder called “originals”. This is where I store all the original files. Original files are important because if there is an error in the information or contains an a typo then we have the original to fix it. In addition, it allows us to return to this newsletter if it was a great success and see which articles a wroth preserving for later. Once articles have been approved, you can begin adding them to the newsletter template in the CMS. The template is there to provide you with the best formate for the newsletter. This way you do not have to concern yourself with creating a template each newsletter. There are links to the CMS pages on your desktop. Once you get into the CMS, you can create a new article by pushing the New Article button. Although that is pretty simple, each article needs to have four headlines. The headlines are for web, print, newsletter, and subscription. They are usually all the same headline, but the article won’t publish correctly without all four filled in. If it is not publishing, just go back and check to see if you have all the headlines filled. It is also important to choose a category for the article. Thankfully this is a pretty simple task. Since the newsletter is children’s-themed, you always want to choose the options under “children’s”. If it is an interview or profile, you should choose the option “Author”. If it is related to bookselling news you should choose that category. Bookselling news is anything like a trade fair, book fair, author convention, events and so forth.

It’s usually pretty easy to tell if something is book news or author news, but if you feel confused you can ask someone. We also have the category “Common Core”. This comes up pretty rarely but is, as the name suggests, about the Common Core. I probably did too much explaining on a simple task, but it’s better to over explain than have left any confusion about what to do. But just be sure to select the appropriate category for the article.
After you choose the category, you can copy and paste the article into the article content box. Often, formatting doesn’t carry over properly so it is important to check and make sure all the italics and other aspects of the original copy over. Be sure that no meaning is changed during the process of copy and pasting, nor do you want a word that is missing a letter because of poor copying. It is also important to check any hyperlinks that might be in the story. Be sure to click on them in order to see if they will take you to the correct site. You don’t want someone unable to access or, even worse, go to the wrong website because something messed up when copy and pasting. Next, you need to create a blurb for the story. This is usually the first few sentences of the article, but sometimes if the article is less ‘newsy’ it is just a summary of the articles contents. For instance, you don’t want to lead off a profile with a quote as the blurb, even though a quote is often the first thing in the blurb. So, you will need to formulate a suitable blurb to the tone and style of the article, which sounds more difficult than it is. When formatting interviews, it is important to put the questions that the interviewer asks in bold/blue and the intro above the interview in italics. As you probably know, this is to make sure the answers are distinct from the interviewer’s questions. After that, you can save the article and hit “Preview,” which will allow you to look over the material to verify that everything is in order. Read over the article to make sure everything looks good before going back into the article page on the CMS and add any photos. To add photos, scroll down and click “Add Media”. The photos shouldn’t be any wider than 600 pixels otherwise you run the risk of having them exceed the article page and become pixilated. The photo in the first position is always the photo that shows up on the preview. Now, the photos won’t be visible just because you have added them. To actually make the images appear in the article, you add the tag [photo NAMEOFPHOTO width=”600”]. You can make the width smaller if you don’t want it to stretch the entire width of the article page. In fact, it is probably better if you don’t stretch it across the width of the article page because it may affect the quality of the photo or look too bulky. It depends on the photo. You can also add captions below the image. This is just a simple calcification, such as stating the date this phot was taken or naming the people in the photo. This is just simple little tasks that offers clarity for the reader that might not be able to derive full context just from the photo alone. 
 Again check the preview link. If it looks good, you can then go to the newsletter CMS page and add the articles. You should also add a small preview image. We crop preview images in a 5x4 ratio for consistency. Once all of the articles have been proofread and added, and once they are in the template, you should check the newsletter preview. Make sure the blurbs make sense and that they haven’t been cut off. And do not forget to double check to make sure the blurb is appropriate for the article. Make sure the images are clear and not pixelated, and that they are consistently sized. It is also crucial to make sure that none of the advertisements conflict with the stories. The marketing team will add the ads in (but make sure they work) yet it is important that we aren’t running an article about a new book that is being advertised in the issue. It looks like a conflict of interest. If there is an ad for something we have an article about, we can always just hold the article until next week. It is easier to hold an article back another week than to have send an email to advertisement concerning the conflict. This will most likely result in delays and cause the advertisement to put in more work coming up with a replacement advertisement. Once you have everything proof read, send the link to the children’s editor and she will check it out. If there any changes are needed, she will let you know. If she does find anything that needs to be changed, get those done as soon as possible. You should not have to resend the changes back to the editor, because you shouldn’t have made new errors with changes. Therefore, once any final changes have been made, you can send the CMS link to the digital team and they will send it out. Always try to send out the newsletter by 5:00 PM EST. If you don’t send out the newsletter at that time, it may become problematic cause the digital team won’t like having to go past time to check over the newsletter. This is pretty much the basics for getting the newsletter prepared and disturbed to our opt-in subscribers. ",Expand on the writer's instructions.,elaborate
"Today we are going to talk about the music industry. Over the years, the music industry has changed drastically. Going from record and CD stores to everything being completely digital has opened up new doors to many different opportunities, but also shut doors for many companies. In the early 2000s, there were CD stores, record stores, and video stores littering every strip and plaza across the US. Slowly, those stores began to diminish due to digital stores and sites such as Limewire, iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, and now YouTube Music. To say that the digital age has had an effect on this would be an understatement. Children who were born in the late ‘90s and early 2000s spearheaded this digital advancement. Not only were music stores affected, but video stores were affected as well. How long has it been since we’ve even heard about Blockbuster? Netflix has also gone completely digital now. In the past, they used to send out DVDs monthly to their subscribers. This all has to do with ease of access. Not only as Americans, but as humans, we like to find an easy way out of situations and we love when things are available right then and there at our fingertips. It allows us to save our time and spend it on something more important. Being able to unlock your mobile device and/or sign onto your laptop and have the world literally at your fingertips allows for less time to be spent getting in your car and driving to the store to purchase what you were looking for. This, however, was very bad for physical stores. A huge financial decline ensued, as more and more people began to convert to the digital stores. Imagine this: You spend so much money on renting or leasing a business, then to acquire the product, and also to publicize your business for several years, just for some digital store to take all of your customers. Something that you’ve worked on for a very long time has been uprooted by a program that was just created in the span of a year. Financially, you’re struggling, so you have to eventually close down your shop and find something else to bring in the big bucks. Although there are still a few physical shops out there, they are mainly for older generations who still own the devices to play back the material. Most youth from this generation wouldn’t even know how a Walkman worked, even if the instructions were right next to them. At the rate that physical stores were going out of style, so were the playback devices. From Walkmans to CD players, MP3 players, and handheld radio devices, they are rarely seen today. You can now access the material you want to listen to or watch and the playback device within one console: a laptop, tablet, iPad, or other mobile device. This saves us, the consumers, money as well. Instead of having to spend money on the material and the device, we make a one-time payment on the device and several small payments on the material. Unfortunately, this has made us lazier. Movie nights, binge watching, and TV series have allowed for us to be more stagnant in the work that we do everyday if we let them. We have to motivate ourselves to get physical throughout the day when everything is, again, at our fingertips. Most physical store owners were not left behind. After realizing that those stores were no longer a necessity, they began investing in their own competition. This allowed them to reap the benefits of what the competitor is making and receiving.","Today, we are going to talk about the music and movie industries. Over the years, the shopping experience has changed drastically. With music, records and CD stores were all the rage. Customers could go in and browse all the available options and purchase the latest and greatest. Now, everything has become entirely digital. With this technological boom, certain companies have been able to thrive, and they have been able to maximize different opportunities. But unfortunately, not every company can say the same; the digital era has shut doors for many.
In the early 2000s, there were CD stores, record stores, and video stores littering every strip and plaza across the US. The demand for these stores was high as physically purchasing music was one of the only options to consume music. Slowly, one by one, those stores began to diminish. Because of digital stores and sites, these physical stores could not stay afloat. Some of the more popular digital stores and sites include Limewire, iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, and YouTube Music.
To say that the digital age has affected music and people would be an understatement. Children born in the late '90s and early 2000s spearheaded this digital advancement. The effects were so massive that some children have never been to a CD or record store as they no longer existed. Unfortunately, music stores were not the only form of media affected. Video stores were also affected. Like the music industry, certain video companies have been able to thrive as they have been able to maximize different opportunities. But unfortunately, only some companies can say the same; How long has it been since we've heard about Blockbuster? Blockbuster was a video store superstar back in the day. Not only did they rent videos, but they also rented video games. By 1994, nine years after the first Blockbuster store opened, Blockbuster became a multibillion-dollar company. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had more than 9,000 stores worldwide. However, by 2007, Blockbuster started to fall. The store needed help keeping up with digital competitors like Netflix and cable. The digital phenomenon eliminated the need for consumers to go to a separate store for their movies. So as Blockbuster failed in this digital boom, Netflix rose to the occasion.
Netflix originally started as a blend of physical and digital. Users could subscribe to Netflix's platform and browse a vast selection of movies digitally. Since Netflix was a digital platform, it had more movie options than physical stores, as Netflix did not have the same physical movie storage constraints. Netflix would then send physical copies of movies and shows to the customers, and the customers could return the movies/shows by mail. Through this business model, the customer never had to leave the seat of their couch. But like most successful companies now, Netflix has also gone entirely digital. Digital has to do with ease of access. As Americans, and simply just humans, we like to find an easy way out of situations. We love when things are available right then and there at our fingertips for immediate gratification. It allows us to save time and spend it on something more substantial. Technology has made us all more impatient today than five years ago. Now as consumers, it is ingrained in us that we have a right to avoid discomfort, such as waiting in long lines and dealing with rude staff. Being able to unlock any device, cell phone, laptop, Alexa, or Google to do shopping has given us more time and more opportunities to avoid discomfort. All of this isn't good for physical stores.
For physical stores, a substantial financial decline ensued as more and more people began to convert to digital stores. Imagine this scenario: You spend so much money on renting or leasing a business, possibly your whole life savings! Then you need to research a product, speak to different merchants, and finally acquire the product. Once you've done all that, you must publicize your business. Posting advertisements in the newspaper and taking out money to get a billboard. In addition, you have to put on a smile every day to deal with customers and staff. After all this hard work for several years, sales dwindle, and eventually, you can't afford to make rent, let alone any additional money to pay your staff or yourself. You're forced to close the shop. Something you've worked hard on for a long time has been uprooted and destroyed by a digital business created in just a year. Not only have you invested money, but you also have invested your time and livelihood just for some digital store to take all your customers. Like many other physical store owners, you must abandon your dream. Although there are still a few physical shops, they are mainly niche shops that survive for the older generations who still own the devices to play back the material.
Most youths from this generation would need help to identify playback devices correctly. They would only know how a Walkman worked if the instructions were beside them. At the rate that physical stores were going out of style, so were the playback devices. These devices are rarely seen today, from Walkmans to CD players, MP3 players, and handheld radio devices. Once popular and desired, these devices collect dust in the back of the closet or a thrift store. Since movies and music can now be accessed digitally within one console, most people do not feel the need to purchase a separate singular-use playback device. Laptops, tablets, iPad, or other smart mobile devices can all play material, making them multi-use devices. Financially, this saves the consumer money. Instead of spending money on individual movies and songs and the playback device, we can make a one-time payment for a device and several small settlements on the material. Many streaming services have become popular as they allow one flat fee to watch unlimited movies or listen to any song. Many platforms, such as Youtube and Spotify, offer free content as long as you can sit through commercials. Unfortunately, this has also made us lazier. As it is so easy to consume media, binge-watching has become the norm. Technology has permitted us to be more stagnant in our everyday life; this sometimes seeps into our work if we let it. Americans tend to prioritize immediate rewards and ignore future costs. Some scientists have attributed this to be wired in by evolution. While this technological boom has benefits, Americans are now spoiled child that wants everything -- quick profits, the latest entertainment devices, and the newest smartphone model. We must motivate ourselves to stay active throughout the day when everything is at our fingertips, and we can easily choose to be lazy.
In the end, it is not all bad. Most physical store owners were not abandoned and left to suffer. After realizing their physical stores were no longer necessary, they began investing in their competition. Although they have lost a lot, at least investing allowed them to reap the benefits of what the competitor was making and receiving. In a positive light, there has been a recent surge in social media in favor of supporting small businesses. Thriving small businesses have learned from the demise of physical stores and have been able to adapt to changes in the market. According to local surveys, optimism among small business owners is the highest in eight years. ",Elaborate on how digital technology influences music and movie industries,elaborate

"Today I am going to be talking about how to effectively manage a call center. It is a topic I am very familiar with, and I have a lot of information to share. The first thing that any person looking to manage a call center will need is a lot of patience. Between staff issues, technical problems and customer complaints, there are many points of running a call center that can be stressful. As a manager, you need to be able to keep calm under pressure and also help others cope with any pressures. Staff members will look to you for reassurance and guidance, so you need to always be prepared to help. You also need to have some prior knowledge regarding the equipment you are using, because if something goes wrong, you will need to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Every minute the phones aren’t answered is costing the company money, and possibly causing a customer complaint. You will also need to be an understanding and empathetic person as your staff members will often come to you for help and advice, and you need to be able to help them effectively. As a manager, you will also be required to handle escalated customer complaints and defuse possible tensions. This is where the patience and empathy will come in handy. Customers can often be demanding and impatien. You, as the manager, will need to make the time to listen to their issue and offer an appropriate solution. You will also need to have the ability to not take things personally. Sometimes, customers will vent their frustrations on the first person they see or speak to. As the first point of call for the company, you need to be able to conduct yourself in a professional manner to staff and customers. You need to be able to leave your problems and stresses at home and go to work with a positive attitude. Customers will be able to tell if you are not in a good mood, and they will not appreciate it if you take your feelings out on them. One of the most crucial points is attention to detail. Regardless of the type of company you work for, or what you are selling or offering, attention to detail is imperative. Mistakes cost the company money and that’s not good. Let’s be real, mistakes do happen. Nobody is perfect, but you when you make a mistake, you need to notice it promptly and address the issue. Any issues that may seem small to you may be a big issue to the company or to the customer, so pay close attention. I would advise double-checking all work completed just to avoid any mistakes, even if it takes longer the first time. You are saving time by not having to go back and correct any mistakes. The customer and the company will thank you for your attention to detail. If you are looking to become a call center manager, you will need to be passionate about what you are offering as a business, whether it be stationery or apples. Passion is fundamental. Your passion will reflect in everything you do, and it will rub off on others around you. Having passion in your job is the key to happiness. Not every day will be a great day, but as long as you try, that’s all anyone can do. Solving customer issues can also be rewarding. Customers will go out of their way to thank you for helping them and so will your team! Many people think working in a call center is just picking up a phone, but it is so much more than that. You are the face of the company. You are the person the customer interacts with. You are the person selling the products. Without you, there would be no “us”. I have worked as a call center manager for many years now, and I find it a rewarding role. It’s not without its challenges, but that’s what makes every day different and interesting. You will need to change things up to keep things fresh, otherwise you will lose interest and passion — and by that point maybe even your job. Switch things up by answering with a different greeting, changing around your script (if you use one). Offer different products that you might not have offered before. Just do something different from yesterday and you’ll notice a big difference not only in your mood but also your attention span. Doing the same tasks every day might seem boring, but it’s all about PMA — Positive Mental Attitude. If you tell yourself that you’re unhappy, then you’re unhappy. If you answer the phone with a smile and tell yourself you’re in a good mood, the customer will notice, and it may even help their own mood or attitude! We have all said to ourselves at one point or another “I can’t be bothered”. But we tell ourselves we can’t be bothered, no one else has told us to feel this way. It all comes down to how you want to feel, and if you want to feel in a better mood you truly can do that and it makes all the difference, not just for you and your mental health, but also for your fellow staff members and for your customers. So, as we conclude this task, I just want to say that I hope these tips are useful, and I hope that anyone else working in the same industry can relate to this. Trying to write 1000 words on a topic is daunting to say the least! But once I started, I was really on a roll. It actually made me think of the times that I’ve felt stuck in life, or at a dead end. Just pick yourself up and at least try to start a new day, week or hour. My time has run over, but at least I got to the word count. Thank you for having me on this test. I look forward to the next one.","Today, I will discuss effective call center management, a topic I am well-versed in and eager to share my knowledge. An essential quality required for a call center manager is an abundance of patience. Managing a call center can be arduous, with numerous stressors. One of the most significant stressors is dealing with difficult or angry customers who may be upset with the company, its products or services, or something else entirely. It would be best if you were skilled at handling these situations professionally and calmly, which can be stressful in and of itself. Another potential stressor is high call volumes, particularly during busy times of the day or year. Your employees may feel overwhelmed by the number of calls they must take and need more time to address each customer's concerns adequately. This can lead to pressure and stress, mainly if some strict targets or goals need to be met. Other potential stressors include lacking support or training, feeling undervalued or underpaid, dealing with technical issues or equipment failures, and working long or irregular hours.
Additionally, call center work can be repetitive, contributing to boredom or a lack of motivation over time. As the manager, it is imperative to remain composed and support staff members. The team will look up to you for guidance and assurance, making it necessary to be prepared for any challenges.
Moreover, having prior knowledge of the equipment used in the call center is essential, as any malfunction can lead to delayed response times and customer complaints, ultimately costing the company money. Being empathetic and understanding is also crucial, as staff members will seek your advice and assistance. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. It involves putting yourself in someone else's shoes and seeing things from their perspective without judgment or bias. It is a fundamental component of emotional intelligence and helps people connect with others on a deeper level. Empathy allows individuals to respond appropriately to the needs and emotions of others, which can lead to more positive and meaningful relationships.
As the manager, you are also responsible for handling escalated customer complaints and resolving potential conflicts. Demonstrating patience and empathy can assist in handling demanding and impatient customers, who can become belligerent at times. As the manager, you must listen to their issues attentively and provide appropriate solutions without taking things personally.
Customers may direct their frustrations toward the first person they encounter or speak to. Therefore, as the initial point of contact for the company, it is essential to behave professionally towards staff and customers. It is important to leave personal issues and stress at home and arrive at work with a positive attitude. To avoid bringing emotional stress into position, taking care of yourself outside of work is essential. This means ensuring you get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and engage in activities that help you relax and unwind. It is also helpful to set boundaries between work and personal life, such as turning off work-related notifications outside of work hours and not checking emails or taking work calls during your time. When you arrive at work, take a few minutes to prepare yourself mentally before you start your shift. This can involve taking deep breaths, listening to calming music, or practicing mindfulness. Prioritizing your workload and breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable ones is essential to avoid feeling overwhelmed. If you experience personal stress during work hours, it is critical to address it rather than ignore or suppress it. This can involve taking a short break to practice a stress-reduction technique, such as meditation or stretching, or talking to a trusted colleague or supervisor about what's on your mind. It is also important to remember that it is okay to ask for help, whether from a mental health professional or a supportive friend or family member.
It is important to practice self-compassion and not beat yourself up if you experience personal stress at work. Everyone sometimes experiences stress, which is a normal part of life. By taking care of yourself outside of work, setting boundaries, and practicing stress-reduction techniques, you can minimize the impact of personal stress on your work life and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
Customers can sense when an employee is not in a good mood, which may result in negative feedback. Customers can tell you are in a bad mood over the phone by the tone of your voice, the words you use, and your overall demeanor. When you are in a bad mood, your agent may sound monotonous or flat, lacking enthusiasm or warmth. You may also use negative words or phrases, such as ""unfortunately"" or ""I cannot do that,"" which can convey a negative tone. Additionally, if you are not fully engaged in the conversation and seem distracted or uninterested, the customer may perceive you are not in a positive mood. Ultimately, your attitude and demeanor can significantly impact the customer's experience, so you must be mindful of how you come across over the phone. 
Paying attention to details is critical, regardless of the business type or product. Attention to detail is essential in business for several reasons. It helps ensure that products and services are high quality and meet customer expectations. Mistakes and errors can lead to customer dissatisfaction, negative reviews, and lost business. Attention to detail can help prevent costly mistakes from impacting a company's bottom line. This can include things that could be improved in accounting, shipping, and other business areas. Finally, attention to detail is vital for maintaining a professional image and reputation. Customers and business partners often view companies known for their attention to detail as more trustworthy and reliable. Attention to detail is a critical component of a successful business strategy. Mistakes can be costly, so prompt detection and resolution are essential. Minor issues may significantly impact the company or the customer, so attention is necessary. Even if it takes longer, double-checking work is advisable to prevent errors and save time in the long run. Both the customer and the company will appreciate the attention to detail. To be a successful call center manager, one must have a passion for the product or service, whether stationery or apples.
Having a strong passion for your work is crucial. Your enthusiasm will be evident in everything you do and inspire those around you. Having a passion for your job is the key to achieving happiness. While not every day will be perfect, as long as you put in the effort, that is all that matters. Helping customers with their issues can also be a rewarding experience. Customers will go out of their way to thank you for assisting them, and so will your team.

"Throughout my experience in the entertainment industry, I have become an expert in costume design for the stage. One of the most important parts of being a costume designer is communication. A designer must effectively communicate with all members of the design team for each production he is a part of, not to mention effective communication with the director of the production. In the past four years, I have  designed costumes for children’s theatre, big-budget theatres, and small professional theaters. One of the most important things to start with when you are designing a play is the script. I find that I must read the script at least three times before I can even start to think about the costumes. The first read is to understand the story. Read the play as if you are an audience member experiencing the play for the first time. I find that not thinking about anything, but plot the first time through helps me to experience a fresh take on the play and identify personal thoughts and feelings that I experience while reading. The second read is to look for deeper meanings. This is when I will start to analyze subtextual meanings, symbolism, and relationships. I am still not thinking about the costumes at this point, only about the greater meaning of the work. The third read is when I will start to think about the challenges a script presents, such as quick changes, double-castings, and other unique scenarios that would present a problem with the design. After this, I am ready to attend the first design meeting with the director and the rest of the design staff. In the first meeting between the designers, director, assistant directors, and stage managers, think about the particular elements you want to bring out within the context of the play. For instance, a director may want to emphasize the relationship between siblings, or the importance of clear communication. The most important thing at this stage is to make sure that whatever you are trying to bring out is in the play. There is nothing worse than a production when the director has forced a concept on a story that it doesn’t belong in. I, personally, have seen many productions in which a director has created a product that could have been great, but is instead tedious, because the entire time I’m thinking about how the concept makes no sense within the story. After the team has discussed the conceptual piece of the play, the concerns with the script must be addressed. It is not important to figure out solutions to these issues at the moment; it is more of a chance to voice them to the room for advice, comments, and brainstorming. After this meeting, a designer is ready to start doing their research. Research comes in all shapes and sizes when it comes to costume design. For some plays, it may mean looking at microfilm in the library to understand a certain historical event. For others, it may mean looking at recent apparel adds to research fashion trends. More often than not, I do my research almost exclusively online, as the internet is an effective platform to share your research with anyone involved, such as the director or an assistant designer. I generally create a folder on a cloud storage platform for each show, and use that folder as a dumping ground for any images I come across that interest me. This way, I have research images for any renderings that I may draft, and I have reminders of my thought processes in case I cannot remember why I thought of a particular solution or piece. It is important to remember throughout all stages of the design that there is no right answer. Though there may be a wrong answer, there isn’t one specific way to do things. After I gather all of my research, I will usually put specific images together in a PowerPoint document with a slide for each character. This will include the character’s general color palette and a sense of the pieces a character would have in their closet. Ideally, after this stage, the designer and the director are on the same page on the ideas being represented by each character. However, if they are not on the same page, it should become apparent by the director's reaction to the research. This is also a good time to catch up on the research of another designer in the room to make sure the production is moving in a cohesive direction. After this, I usually like to read the script again to remind myself of everything I’ve thought about thus far. In this read, I will usually comb through to find any mention of specific pieces in the dialogue. For instance, if the characters are all talking about someone’s red dress, I need to make sure that the character is in a red dress. After this, I will start line drawing. A line drawing indicates the shape of the garments you intend to design without bringing color into the picture. If a designer would like, they can also present a color pallette, but it is not necessary. This way, the director of the production can approve piecesor steer the designer in a new direction with alternative feedback. After this meeting, everyone on the design team ideally knows essentially what the show will look like. This is when a designer can start adding color to the rendering. I usually color my renderings with watercolor, because that is what I was taught in school. At the final meeting, the designers will present final designs and hopefully get approval from the director. If not, there may be an issue with the research or with the interpretation of the play. After this is done, the designer will start to pull pieces from stock, buy new pieces, or build new pieces.","Because of my extensive experience in the entertainment industry, I have become an expert in costume design for the stage. Costume design is an integral part of the theatrical experience, as it helps make characters look real and contributes to the overall setting of the production. One of the most important parts of being a costume designer is the communication aspect. It is the key to making sure that things go smoothly for everyone and that there are no glitches as the work progresses. A designer must effectively and continuously communicate with each and every member of the design team for each production he is a part of. It is important to have effective communication with the director of the production to ensure that the costumes help bring the vision of the director to life. Lack of communication often leads to errors in judgment and shoddy work that negatively affects everyone involved in the design process. In the past four years, I have designed various costumes for children’s theaters, big-budget theaters, and small professional theaters, so I have a lot of experience and I will share it in detail. One of the most important and critical things to start with when you are designing a play is the script. Understanding a script is the key to success. I find that I must read the script at least three times before I can even start to think about the costumes. The first read is just to understand the story, but the subsequent reads make you familiar with the setting and the characters and help you identify any key themes or motifs that can be incorporated into the costume design to make relevant apparel for the play. I would suggest that during your first reading of the play, read it as if you were an audience member experiencing or watching the play for the first time. You are taking in the characters, settings, and every twist and turn in the script. I find that keeping my mind clear and not thinking about anything but the plot the first time through helps me experience a fresh take on the play and identify personal thoughts and feelings that I experience while reading it. This is very important to get things right and perfect. I always go for a second reading to look for deeper and more intricate meanings. This is when I will start to analyze and think about subtextual meanings, tone, subtleties, symbolism, and relationships between the characters. I will study the characters more closely. Remember that I am still not thinking about the costumes for the characters at this point, only about the greater meaning of the work at hand. The third read is when I will actually start to think about the challenges a script presents, such as quick changes, double castings, and other unique scenarios that would present a problem with the design and hamper the execution of the play. After this third read, I feel that I am ready to attend the first design meeting with the director and the rest of the design staff. It is here that things start to come together. In the first meeting between the designers, director, assistant directors, and stage managers, always think about all the particular elements you want to bring out within the context of the play. Take for instance, a director may want to emphasize the relationship between siblings or the importance of clear communication. And you have to make sure that you understand it perfectly as you start and pay attention to the subtleties. Also, make sure that you are well prepared before the meeting takes place. The most important thing at this stage is to be sure of whatever you are trying to bring out in the play. It should be intrinsic to it and not forced or look as if it does not belong. You must know that there is nothing worse than a production when the director has forced a concept into a story that it does not belong in. It seems like a misfit and brings down the impact of the play. I, personally, have seen many productions in which a director has created a product that could have been great and had the potential to be outstanding but is instead tedious because the entire time I am thinking about how the concept makes no sense within the story. It just pulls down the whole thing. After the team has discussed the conceptual piece of the play and reviewed all its aspects, the concerns and issues in the script must be addressed promptly. It must be done meticulously. You must remember that it is not important to figure out solutions to these issues at the moment. That can be done at a later stage. Here, it is more of a chance to voice them in the room for advice, random comments, and creative brainstorming so that everyone is aware of every little thing that could jeopardize the whole effort. After this initial meeting occurs, a designer is more or less ready to start doing their research. Never underestimate the importance of research in this field as it can enhance or reduce the quality of the costumes. The research comes in varied shapes and sizes when it comes to costume design, and it is vast and diverse. For some plays, it may mean researching or looking at microfilm in the library to understand a certain historical or political event that is an intrinsic part of the script. For other plays or productions, it may mean looking at recent apparel additions to research fashion trends that will do justice to the characters you are working on. More often than not, I do my research almost exclusively online, as the internet is an effective platform to share your research with anyone involved, such as the director or an assistant designer. It gives me flexibility and speed to quicken the process and get feedback on my research very promptly. I generally have the habit of creating a folder on a cloud storage platform for each show and always using that folder as a dumping ground for any images I come across that interest me or that I think might be useful to me in the future. This is a very good practice that helps in getting the right ideas and enables experimentation with costumes. So with the help of this process, I usually save researched images for any renderings that I may draft and I have reminders of my thought processes in case I cannot remember why I thought of a particular solution or piece to use in the play. Everything seems well documented and well planned with the help of this process. Now, it is important to remember throughout all stages of the design that there cannot be a right answer. How one approaches something could differ; it could be done in multiple ways. Though there may be a wrong answer and you could end up making an error, there is not one specific way to do things right. So, after I gather and compile all of my research work, I will usually put specific and relevant images together in a PowerPoint document with a slide for each character in the play. This will include the character’s general color palette and a sense of the pieces a character would have in their closet. Ideally, after this stage, the designer and the director are on the same page about the ideas being represented by each character and what kind of costumes would work well for the script and add to the production quality. However, there are times when things are different and the designer and the director are not on the same page. They may not agree on one or various aspects of your research. It should become apparent from the director's reaction to the research whether they are happy about it or not. It is critical to understand what he has to say at this point. This is also a very good time to catch up on the research of another designer in the room to make sure the production is moving properly in a cohesive direction and everyone is on the same page. After this, I usually like to read the script again to remind myself of everything I have thought about thus far. This is a sort of revision and fact-check. In this read, I will usually meticulously comb through to find any mention of specific pieces in the dialogue. This is important as we tend to overlook important facts. Take for instance, if the characters are all talking about a specific character's red dress in the play, I need to make sure that the character is wearing a red dress or that will be taken as an error and bring down the impact of the play. After this step, I usually start with line drawings. A line drawing indicates the shape of the garments you intend to design without bringing color into the picture. If a designer would like, they can also present a color palette, but it is not necessary. It is a personal choice to go for different kinds of line drawings. It depends on how you want to go about it and what effects you would like to present. These drawings help the designer, the director, and relevant parties to visualize how the costumes will look on stage and allow for any necessary adjustments to be made before the costumes are actually constructed and utilized. This way, the director of the production can easily approve pieces or make an effort to steer the designer in a new direction with alternative feedback. After this meeting, everyone on the design team ideally knows essentially what the show will look like. The picture becomes clearer about the vision and expectations of the director. This is a good time when a designer can start adding color to the rendering to bring it to life. I personally like to usually color my renderings with watercolor because that is what I was taught in school. Watercolor is a great medium for costume designers, and it really helps to express the design effectively. But then again, it is an individual preference to work with the medium you are comfortable with. At the final meeting, the designers will present their final designs and hopefully get approval from the director. If they do not get approved, there may be an issue with the research or with the interpretation of the play. So, they should work on correcting it and implementing the new directions. After this is done, the designer is expected to pull pieces from stock, buy new pieces, or build new pieces to create costumes for the play. This is the fun part as the designs begin to come to life and enhance the impact of the characters. Throughout the entire process, it is important for the designer to be quite flexible and adaptable. Unexpected changes may occur, and the designer will need to be able to adjust the design to accommodate these changes. 
In conclusion, costume design is quite a complex process that requires a combination of communication, creativity, research, flexibility, and technical skills. A successful costume designer must be able to work closely with the director and other members of the design team to create costumes that accurately reflect the characters and the overall style of the production. With careful planning, attention to detail, and a willingness to be flexible, a costume designer can create costumes that enhance the theatrical experience for both the performers and the audience.

"This essay is about the profound relationship of male sexuality to female sexuality and its socially individual variables, which have to be considered in terms of any social interaction. You as my potential customer will receive a quick and informative overview over the gender dynamics of male and female beings, so you’re going to be able to consider the most important factors of this dynamic within the context of your future social interactions with the opposite gender. Starting out with the harsh reality of both genders not being aware of each other’s desires , today’s men and women are facing a serious problem of ineffective intergender communication. This lack of quality communication between the sexes leads to a broad variety of societal challenges when it comes to successful attraction and retainment of a desired mate for copulation, as well as the continued nurturingof family bonds. Societal and scientific institutions haven’t been able to figure out the underlying dynamics of intergender behavior and communication, and they are additionally struggling to communicate the discoveries that have been made so far to the public. Generally speaking, intergender behavior (better known as dating/mating dynamics) are based on profound evolutionary principles going back millions of years to our very early ancestors. One example of those underlying principles is women’s desire for a “real man” or “alpha male”, who can be recognized through certain intrinsic characteristics, as well as specific external achievements and accomplishments. In public, common belief states that most women desire a rich, good-looking man for the sole purpose of accessing his materialistic gains. This may be partly true, since material abundance usually leads to a more secure, more comfortable existence through abundance of time, choices and higher quality resources. Contrary to this belief are examples of men, who indeed are in ownership of the same intrinsic characteristics like self-discipline, emotional self-control, work ethic, industriousness, etc., but who do not have accomplished or acquired a similar financial or materialistic status yet. These men are still desired by the majority of women despite their lack (or willfully chosen absence) of financial and materialistic success. These exceptions do highlight the theory of women being attracted to so-called alpha males, even if they don’t display the full range of characteristics internally as well as externally. Only a subset of alpha traits seems to be sufficient for the successful attraction of a mate for future copulation. A reason for this might be either expected external success in the future due to existing intrinsic characteristics, or the sheer presence of intrinsic characteristics as being good enough to make the female feel secure and protected enough to engage in copulation. In both cases, this result would serve as evidence against the popular belief that only good-looking, successful, and rich males receive all the attraction from the female population. This would also indicate that men not being part of a rich and successful family, nor being genetically gifted with good looks right after birth would be able to increase the attraction received by females through learning and adapting to the mentioned alpha characteristics. Conscious display of these characteristics would then eventually lead to more successful interactions with female mating partners, as well as more efficient intergender communication through understanding these attraction principles with the opposite gender. Without understanding these principles, both genders (but primarily men) increasingly face a more challenging world in terms of accomplishing sexual interactions, dating frequency and quality as well as long-term family bonds. After having studied and experimented with these principles for years, you as my potential customer will be guaranteed the proper access (and therefore understanding) of the most important and vital mating principles. The correct understanding of these will help you to dramatically increase your personal future prospects in the short- and long-term mating and dating market. No matter if male or female – the correct interpretation of the behavioural nuances of the opposite sex is vital to access an actionable system for the improvement of your own personal behavioural aspects and subtleties. Not only will you learn how to adapt an attractive appearance through proper style, clothing and expression in terms of body language, articulation, and expression. In addition, very complex concepts like internal belief systems, conscious choice of self-talk and the reading of other people’s psychology will be taught in a quickly adaptable way for you to implement right on the spot. Therefore, immediate short-term as well as long-term success with the opposite sex and in terms of intergender communication and interaction can be guaranteed by me personally. Also beneficial for other aspects of your private as well as professional life, this broad set of skills is an essential part on the journey to becoming a sophisticated person, including all internal, positive changes as well as external accomplishments like money, high social status, and materiali abundance of choice in quality and quantity terms. Only through the correct interpretation of existing laws and principles will you be able to achieve the life of your dreams. Only through acquiring the essential knowledge  will you be able to improve yourself, but also your current circumstances if you have the desire to do so. Beyond the common belief of proper education within the academic system, I personally believe in lifelong learning. This is a unique opportunity to gain vital knowledge about the real underlying principles of intergender dynamics and all its subtlte nuances, whose neglect can lead to detrimental consequences. In conclusion, learning about the most successful communication and mating strategies of both males and females will help you to improve the areas of your life you wish to increase in quality and also in quantity if necessary. These changes cannot be made through common sense alone, nor through the implementation of knowledge taught within the realm of the academic system of schools, universities and other public institutions. These sources of knowledge have proven their lack of efficiency within their ability of fully discovering all existent principles and are in conclusion not suited as capable of successfully teaching them yet either.","This piece of writing is in regards to the extremely complex relationship of a male’s sexual instinct compared to a female’s sexual instincts and the varying differences that come into existence in a social context, which, in turn, are required to be thought about in regards to any and every interaction with a person socially. Because of the possibility of you becoming my customer, you will be receiving a short, simple and information filled synopsis in regards to the gender dynamics of both male and female human beings. So, within the context of being exposed to all of the factors, as in, your eventual socially motivated interactions with the opposite gender, you are going to have the ability to think about the most important ones within these dynamics. Starting the process with the hard to accept reality of both men and women not being cognitively observant of what each other wants. 
Our modern men and women are starting to experience a considerably noteworthy problematic situation of communication between genders that is not effective in any way. The fact that there is a lack of good quality communication between both men and women can only lead to a very large sum of conflicts in society when it comes to being able to successfully attract and retain whatever mate they desire for sexual relations, as well as the continued sustaining and caretaking of family bonds. Institutions that have a hard focus on science and society have not had the ability to solve and understand the inherently subtextual inner workings of behavior and communication between men and women, and they are additionally finding a number of conflicts in communicating the discoveries that they have been able to make so far to the general public.
In a general sense, behavior between men and women (more famously known as dating/mating dynamics) are based on extremely complex principles in evolution that dates back millions of years to those that came before us, early in our history. One piece of empirical evidence of those inherently subtextual principles is the convention of a woman's desire for a “real man” or “alpha male”, who are able to be found out due to certain inherent mannerisms and intrinsic characteristics, as well as specific real life achieved experiences and accomplished goals. Within the general public, it is common belief that a majority of women want to find a well off, good looking man, with the entire motivation only being the ability to have access to his materialistic gains. This has a chance to have a portion of truth, due to material abundance having a tendency of leading to a more secure, more comfortable way of life because of a surplus of time, choices and resources of higher quality. In opposition to this way of thinking are empirical pieces of evidence of a number of men, who in fact are in ownership of those same exact inherently subtextual character qualities such as the ability to discipline themselves, the ability to control their emotions, the ability to have work ethic, the ability to be industrious, etc., but who have not been able to accomplish or acquire a similar financial or materialistic status as of yet. These men still gain attraction by a large sum of women even when recognizing their unfortunate lack (or, possibly, willfully chosen absence) of success both in regards to the financial and materialistic. 
These outlying pieces of evidence do put the light on the theoretical idea of women having an attracted feeling toward what is known as alpha males, even if they do not have the ability to present the full range of aspects of character on the inside as well as on the outside. Only a certain type of alpha character aspects give evidence in being good enough for a successful attempt in the attraction of a sexual partner for future sexual relations. One idea that gives evidence of this has a chance of either being anticipated financial and materialistic success in the inevitable future due to existing inherently subtextual character aspects, or simply the sheer presence of inherently subtextual character aspects as being just the right amount for convincing the female to have a secure and protected feeling, enough to engage in sexual relations. In both of these cases, if they happened, the results would be able to serve as evidence that helps to refute the well known idea that only good looking, financially and materialistically successful males are able to receive the entirety of the attraction from the female population. This would also indicate that men not being part of a rich and successful family, nor being genetically gifted with good looks right after birth would be able to increase the attraction received by females through learning and adapting to the mentioned alpha characteristics. 
Conscious display of these characteristics would then eventually lead to more successful interactions with female mating partners, as well as more efficient intergender communication through understanding these attraction principles with the opposite gender. Without understanding these principles, both genders (but primarily men) increasingly face a more challenging world in terms of accomplishing sexual interactions, dating frequency and quality as well as long-term family bonds. After having studied and experimented with these principles for years, you as my potential customer will be guaranteed the proper access (and therefore understanding) of the most important and vital mating principles. The correct understanding of these will help you to dramatically increase your personal future prospects in the short- and long-term mating and dating market. It does not matter if the subject is male or female, due to the fact that the correct interpretation and understanding of the behavior based nuances and idiosyncrasies of whichever sex is the opposite is extremely vita in order to have the ability to have access to a system that you can take action on for the improvement of your own personally decided behavior based aspects and subtleties. 
You will not only be able to educate yourself on what it takes to adapt yourself into an attractive appearance through the correct aesthetic, style, articles of clothing and mannerisms in regards to your body language and how you hold yourself, articulation and how you describe yourself,  and expression. In addition to this, very complex theoretical concepts such as what you believe in, the conscious choice of how you talk to yourself, and how you read other people’s psychology will be taught to you in such a way that will be quickly adaptable, in order for you to be able to implement and act upon right on the spot. In turn, immediate evidence of short term as well as long term success with the opposite sex and in terms of communication and interaction between men or women is able to be a guarantee by me personally. One thing that is also able to be beneficial for the other aspects of your private as well as professional and fiscal based life, this broad set of skills and understandings of social concepts shows proof of being an extremely essential and necessary box of tools when you are on the journey to evolving into a sophisticated and successful human being. This is including all of the internal, positive changes and alterations as well as real life accomplishments and achieved goals like ones having to do with fiscal responsibilities, high status in a social sense, and material abundance of choice in terms of both quality and quantity. 
The only way to get it is through a system that allows you to correctly interpret the existing social laws and principles. If you are able to grasp this system, you will have the ability to achieve the life that you have always dreamed of. The only way to get it is through acquiring the essential knowledge. Once you have, you will be able to provide improvements to yourself, and also the circumstances you are currently going through, if you have been able to gain the desire to do so. Looking past the well known idea of the correct education within the academic system, I am a personal believer in learning throughout the entirety of your life. This is also just a unique opportunity that allows you to be able to gain vital knowledge in regards to the real inherently subtextual principles of dynamics between men and women, and all of the subtle nuances and idiosyncrasies that comes with it, which if chosen to be neglected, has a chance of leading to consequences that could end up being detrimental. In my final words, I will say this, giving yourself the knowledge in regards to the most successful way of communicating, and strategies of mating for both the male and female gender will be of great assistance to you in improving the areas of your life that you wish to increase in terms of quality and also in the amount if you deem it necessary. These changes and alterations in such things as attitude, style, and motivation are not only able to be made through common sense alone, nor through the implementation of what is taught within the realm of the academic system of educational schools, universities and other publically based institutions. These sources of knowledge and ways of teaching have given evidence of how little efficiency they have in their ability to fully find and identify all of the existent inherent and subtextual principles. So, they are in conclusion not suited, and cannot be labeled as capable of successfully educating these individuals as of yet as well.","Flesh out the source text, add more informaiton about male and female sexual instincts.",elaborate
"There are many ways that an A&R can successfully become an independent advisor. This only works best if that A&R has many certified credentials. A&R business is one aspect in the music industry that is often overlooked. Many times artists are under developed and lack many skills that most successful artists have had in the past. Professionalism, performance, and grace are some of the missing keys that most new artists lack due to heavy pressure from labels to launch and release artists without proper preparation. Quick sales are more prevalent in the business over the longevity of a career of an artist.  Many label executives control and dominate the musical market and A&Rs are often left out of the conversation. A&Rs are the thread of the label. They make everything work smoothly and ensure that the artist can sustain long nights on the road, performing in front of thousands of people, and that they have the best music and lyrics for their albums.","There are a plethora of ways for an A&R to successfully transition into becoming an independent advisor. This process works best if the A&R has plenty of certified credentials already under their belt. A&Rs are often an overlooked part of the music industry, but they do critical work on its behalf. There have been plenty of artists whose work suffered because they were under-developed and were never given the opportunity to acquire many of the skills that the most successful artists in the past had been able to accumulate.  Professionalism, performance, and grace are just a few examples of the talents that most modern artists struggle to learn due to heavy pressure from labels to launch and release artists without proper preparation. The industry today seems to value the profit to be made by many quick sales over the longevity and well-being of the artists themselves. This lack of investment in the artists’ well-being can in turn have a devastating effect on their long-term career prospects. Many label executives dominate and control the musical market and are too often able to cut A&Rs out of conversation entirely. This is an unfortunate loss for all parties involved, because A&Rs are the thread of the label. They are responsible for ensuring that everything runs smoothly between the artist and the label, taking care of the artist’s needs while balancing the responsibilities of the label. A&Rs are the reason that artists can manage long nights on the road, enduring long tours, and they make sure that those artists are prepared to perform before thousands of people when they arrive, giving those folks the very best music, lyrics, and performance possible, time and time again.
A&Rs are also responsible to the record labels for much more than the general well being of the artists they’re assigned. In fact, they generally end up building up their own contacts and relationships with the artists they work with since they typically act as talent scouts for their labels.",Elaborate on the role of A&Rs in the music industry.,elaborate

"Well, I find that the twenty years that I have been in the workforce.  The biggest problem with companies is respect and communication.  If you have a company that is a big office corporation, there is little to no communication among the co-workers.

One of these is that the largest issue companies seem to suffer from is a lack of internal respect and communication. If a company conducts its business in a large, corporate setting then there is often little to no communication or rapport between co-workers. Many times they are simply handed assignments with little to no instruction provided, and if they attempt to seek clarification on any point they are liable to receive wildly differing answers depending on who they ask. This creates an unharmonious work environment in which every employee seeks to do their work in their own way, with no overall cohesion guiding the project towards an efficient and effective end.

"The second reason that athletes are not successful at tryouts is because they have not perfected the skills that they do have. Even if a kid has been practicing their new skill all year long and they feel that they are able to perform that skill at tryouts, it is often the skills that they have been doing for years that hold them back. A kid can throw a perfect back handspring at tryouts, but if they have not taken the time to perfect their back walkover or front walkover, we will be less likely to place that kid on a level two team, because we need to see them perfect the skills for level one first. This is not meant to hold kids back, but rather encourage them to perfect their skills before moving up in difficulty. This also ensures that they will be able to continue to move up in difficulty, because they have mastered the basics. At all levels, it is important to have the skills from previous levels, because they will still be utilized. It is also important to have these skills because it will make it much easier to learn more difficult skills in the future. Everything comes down to body awareness and control. If a basic skill cannot be performed with body control, that problem will stick with an athlete in every new skill they learn. They may have beautiful tumbling, but a lack of body control will show up when learning to twist or tumble out of jumps.","The second reason that certain athletes can have a difficult time when finding success during their tryouts is due to the fact that they have not been able to perfect the learned skills that they already have within their toolbox of moves. Even in the case of a kid that has been practicing their newly learned skill throughout the entire year, to the point where they have the confidence in their ability to where they want to display themselves performing that skill during their tryouts. It is not rare that the other, older learned skills that they think they have been fine at performing for years, continually keep holding them back from the rest of the kids that may actually have mastered it. A student can be able to throw a back handspring at tryouts without a single misstep or mistake, but if they have not taken it upon themselves to use their time and practice to perfect something such as their back walkover or front walkover, there is less of a chance that will be want to place that student on a team in their second level, due to the fact that we are required to witness them first perfect the rudiments from the first level. This is not served as a means for us to not let kids prosper, but instead try to motivate them to make attempts in perfecting the skills they have learned before moving up and learning more difficult ones that they may not need to learn yet. This is also used as a way to make certain that the students will have the ability to continue to constantly push themselves up in how difficult their moves are, due to the fact that they have been able to perfect the elementary stuff. At every single level of this, it is incredibly important to obtain what you have learned from the levels prior to the one you are on, due to the fact that they will continue to be utilized. It is also very important to obtain and retain what you have learned due to the fact that it will not be very hard at all to educate yourself and retain more difficult skills in the inevitable future. It all comes down to being in control and aware of what your body is doing and how it is doing it. If a rudimentary skill is not able to be performed with control of one’s body, that problem will repeat in every new skill an athlete learns from that point onward. They have just as much of a chance of having beautiful tumbling as a lack of body control showing up when attempting to learn how to do a twist or tumble when exiting their jumps.Practice makes perfect, but it has to be the right type of practice. If you practice the wrong thing for years, you are perfectly mistaken.

"For these types of NPRs, you want to use the reason code unable to reroute. This would be one of the few NPRs that it isn’t necessary to forward to delivery research for review. There are also two different types of exchanges: prepaid exchange and advanced exchange. A prepaid exchange would be if the customer needed a different size or a different color. A prepaid exchange would be processed if the exchange is  not our fault. The customer would be charged upfront for the exchange and would be refunded once the original item was returned and processed. An advanced exchange shouldn’t be used very often. This type of exchange would be used if there was a service error on our part. For example, if we sent the wrong item, the wrong color, or if they received a defective product, we would process the exchange as an advanced exchange. These are processed on our courtesy account. This means that the customer isn’t charged upfront. However, they must return the wrong or defective item within thirty days. If the item isn’t returned within thirty days, the credit card on file will be charged for the item that was not returned. It is very important to let the customer know that the item must be returned to our warehouse by mail within thirty days. If returned in a store, the charge will still generate, as we don’t use the same system for mail orders as we do for the store. If this happens, please contact CCL for resolution. It is also a good idea to tell the customer to keep a copy of the tracking number for the return in case  the returned package gets lost or stolen. For packages that are lost or stolen, we will send out a replacement at no charge, as long as the customer doesn’t have another NPR for a stolen package within the last six months. We don’t have a time limit on returns. Returns are always free. Most packages will arrive with a prepaid return label and form. However, to save on costs, packages shipping from a full-time store may not have a prepaid return label and form included. If the customer needs a label, they can go to Nordstrom’s website and type returns in the search box. They will be able to print out as many prepaid return labels and forms as they need here. Returns are processed within ten to fourteen business days. Refunds are automatically issued to the original form of payment on file. If a gift card or Nordstrom note was used, a refund will be issued in the form of a gift card. Gift cards will be shipped to the original shipping address and arrive within three to six business days. Gift recipients are also able to return items by mail and in store, or they can also print out a return label and form from our website. It is very important that they fill out the gift recipient section on the form to ensure that the exchange or refund is shipped to them and not the gift giver. They may also take their return to the store as well. The sales associate may try to locate the original purchase. They may be able to do so with the name and zip code or phone number of the gift giver. If they are unable to locate the order this way, the gift recipient will be refunded the last sale price of the item. For example, if the item is now on sale for 50% less, they will be refunded that amount without proof of purchase. Nordstrom offers in store gift wrapping to customers as a courtesy. Sadly, the gift wrapping service for online orders costs two dollars per order. We understand that this may upset some customers. However, our warehouses aren’t as easily equipped with these supplies or manpower. Customers can also take items that they purchased online to their local Nordstrom for free gift wrapping. Nordstrom offers a wonderful rewards program for our loyal customers. It is called Nordstrom Rewards. Customers can earn two points per dollar spent when using a Nordstrom brand payment method. This can be the Nordstrom Visa, debit card, or retail card. This doesn’t include a gift card. If a customer would like to use their own credit or debit card, they earn one point per dollar. For every 2,000 points earned, they will receive a twenty dollar note in the mail or via email. These notes can be used online and in stores — at Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, or HauteLook. These expire after one year and cannot be reissued if they expire before the customer uses the note. If you receive any calls from customers regarding their credit account, we don’t have access to that information. In such cases, please transfer them to Nordstrom Credit. They are also available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

An advanced exchange, on the other hand, should not have to be used very often. Advanced exchanges are a type of service offered by some companies where they will send a replacement product to a customer before the customer returns the defective product. This is done so that the customer is not inconvenienced and can continue using the replacement product. At the same time, they arrange to return the defective one. With advanced exchange, the customer usually provides a credit card or other form of payment as collateral, which is charged if they do not return the defective product within a provided timeframe. The customer is also typically responsible for packaging and returning the faulty goods and may be charged additional fees if not. In contrast to a prepaid exchange, this type of exchange would be used if there was a service error on our part.

 It is very important for you to be aware that if the items to be returned as part of the advanced exchange are returned in a store, the charge will still generate. This is because we don’t use the same system for mail orders as we do for the store. If this happens, it may become necessary for you to contact a customer care liaison (CCL) for a resolution. A customer care liaison is a representative who acts as a bridge between a company and its customers. The role of a customer care liaison is to ensure that the needs and concerns of customers are heard and addressed by the company in a timely and effective manner. Customer care liaisons are responsible for handling customer complaints, providing support and assistance, and resolving any issues between customers and the company. They act as a point of contact for customers, helping coordinate communication and ensuring that customers remain informed of any progress or updates regarding their issues or concerns. In addition to working with customers, customer care liaisons also work closely with other departments within the company, such as sales, marketing, and product development. They provide customer feedback and insights that can help the company improve its products and services and its overall customer experience. The role of a customer care liaison is to ensure that customers feel heard, valued, and supported by the company and to work towards building strong and positive relationships between customers and the company.
It is also a good idea to tell the customer to keep a copy of the tracking number for the return in case the returned package gets lost or stolen. For packages that have become lost or stolen, we will send out a replacement at no charge, as long as the customer has not claimed another NPR for a stolen package within the last six months. We do not have a time limit on returns and always ensure that returns are free. The vast majority of packages will arrive with a prepaid return label and form. However, in order to save on costs, packages that have been shipped from a full-time store may not have a prepaid return label and form included. If the customer is in need of a label, they can go to Nordstrom’s website and type  the word “returns” in the search box. They will then be directed to a service which allows them to be able to print out as many prepaid return labels and forms as they need. Returns are typically processed within ten to fourteen business days. Refunds are then automatically issued to the original form of payment on file. If a gift card or Nordstrom note was used, a refund will also be issued in the form of a gift card. Gift cards will be shipped to the original shipping address and usually arrive within three to six business days. Gift recipients are also able to return items by mail and in store, or they have the option to print out a return label and form from our website. It is very important that they fill out the gift recipient section on the form to ensure that the exchange or refund is shipped to them and not to the original gift giver. As previously mentioned, gift recipients may also take their return to the store as well, at which time the sales associate may try to locate the original purchase. The associate may be able to do so successfully if they use the name and zip code or phone number of the gift giver. If, on the other hand, they are unable to locate the order in this way, the gift recipient will then be refunded the last sale price of the item. For example, if the item is now on sale for 50% less, they will be refunded that amount without proof of purchase. 
Nordstrom also offers in store gift wrapping to customers as a courtesy. Sadly, the gift wrapping service for online orders is not offered for free, instead costing two dollars per order. We understand that this may upset some of our valued customers. However, our warehouses are not as easily equipped with the supplies or manpower necessary to offer such services to the same degree as our in store locations. However, customers are allowed to take the items that they purchased online to their local Nordstrom store for free gift wrapping services. Nordstrom also offers a wonderful rewards program for our loyal customers. It is called Nordstrom Rewards. Through Nordstrom Rewards, customers can earn two points per dollar spent when using any Nordstrom brand payment method. These branded payment methods can be the Nordstrom Visa, debit card, or retail card. It is important to note that this list doesn’t include a gift card, however. If a customer would like to use their own credit or debit card instead, they will earn one point per dollar. For every 2,000 points earned, our customers will receive a twenty dollar note in their mail or via email. These notes are valid to be used online and in any in store locations including Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, or HauteLook. These notes will expire after one year and cannot be reissued if they expire before the customer uses the note. If you receive any calls from customers regarding their credit account, let them know that we do not have any access to that information. In such cases, please transfer them to Nordstrom Credit. They are also available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Should you be working in the email queue and receive a time sensitive email, please call the customer. This is because people are far more likely to respond to phone calls in a timely manner, whereas emails often go ignored or unnoticed for verying lengths of time.",Elaborate on the processes involved in conducting returns and exchanges throughout Nordstrom's business model.,elaborate
"The world of the Internet is very wide. In our era you will find a lot of interesting technology that would complete your day-to-day life. This new trend is leveraging the concept of the Internet of Things. These devices that were in the past not connected to the Internet are now available in all retailers. This becomes more and more popular and it all started with the fitness bands. These are bands that let you count all your steps and activity. At first these devices were not very smart or powerful but they were good at doing simple things. Pedometers are the ancestors of fitness bands. The development of these bands is quite impressive. They now have a lot of features and capabilities. People don’t use them to their full potential. The data that is provided by those type of bands can be analysed in such a way that would allow the user to deeply understand their habits. For example, if you see that the step count is very low, you can assume that someone is either sleeping or sedentary. The combination of those steps and other metrics would give you the answer but if we focus on the steps for the moment, you will realise that most of the time people have very similar habits. Their steps could be the same over and over. This is normal and quite expected. Based on that information a model can be created where we can predict what the user will do. For example if a person goes to work every morning at 8:00 a.m. for a long time, the day that the steps count doesn’t go up around that time will allow us to determine that a break in the habit occured. For more information, you can combine the steps with information like the heart rate. Nowadays the devices have those markers quite easily available. The heart rate is even more powerful that the steps. There are only a few moments that can be defined when the heart rate is changing. Either someone is awake and moving around (not exercising), going to the gym, doing exercises, or lying in bed. The last is quite easily identifiable. If you correlate the heart rate with the time of the day, you can assume that the person is sleeping with a good confidence score. The other opportunity that the measurement of the heart rate  allows is to see if someone is under pressure or under stress. By combining the steps with the heart rate, you can have a model that is quite accurate for any sort of activity. For example, if the step count is very low and the heart rate is low, it’s quite obvious that the person is sleeping. If the heart rate is high but step count is low, it’s likely to be gym exercise or treadmill. I’ve never seen a low heart rate and high steps,but I would guess it’s probably an athlete going for a run that doesn’t impact his heart rate. The risk of having those devices collect more data is significant. The manufacturers haven’t used the full potential of the data that is available to them. Instead of analysing and reviewing deeply the information that they have they tend to rush into having more sensors. Those sensors are not always the answer. They can consume battery and therefore not be as good of an option as we think. Unfortunately, manufacturers have to innovate. To me the real innovation is having the ability to make the data talk and to be very good at using the existing technology that allows you to move forward. Being comfortable with the basic technologies is critical for today’s companies. The new and shiny gadgets are not a real demonstration of a company’s innovation. We have had flexible screens for many years but the utilisation as of today is still to be proven. The innovative department of Google called Google X has released nice gadgets from their work but they are not in any way, shape, or form usable by the end users. This is not the future that we should have, and our companies should be more focused on the end user instead of the image that they send. Those parts of the Internet of things are very useful to me. They simply need to be triaged. There are now toothbrushes, umbrellas, and other basic things that we use that are connected. I have difficulty understanding what the purpose of a connected umbrella is. The website advertises that if you forget your umbrella you get a notification. I’m not convinced at all. The same idea with the connected luggages. While it’s good when you lose your luggage to know where it is, I’m not sure how often you will be using that functionality. There is some big filtering to be done in this area and the users are starting to realise that not everything should be connected, as there is no point in doing so. The other trend that is associated with connected devices is the artificial intelligence and machine learning. This to me is the real innovation as long as simple rules are followed. The most important rule for an AI to revolutionize the life or work of someone is that the data it’s collecting is clean. There is an expression in the software industry that says “garbage in, garbage out.” The AI is not a magic tool that would change everything. It will help gradually to understand the amount of data that we have and to make it easily readable for humans. AI doesn’t work on its own. It relies on big data. AI has been around since the ‘50s. One of the first applications of AI was word processing following the scanning of a document. That was a great technology development but nowadays there isn’t a lot of documents that we scan and that we want to turn into text that can be processed. But that task has a specific purpose that the AI was able to tackle.","The world wide web is called what it is for good reason. In the modern world, it is inevitable that you will discover quite a lot of thought provoking technological advancements that have the ability to make your day to day life feel complete. This recently discovered societal pattern has leverage over the concept of the Internet of Things. These updated devices that were not able to be connected to the world wide web in the past are now able to be purchased in every retailer out there. This is something that became more and more popular as time progressed, and it was all motivated by the fitness bands that were invented a few years prior. These wearable pieces of tech are wrist or ankle bands that allow you to keep count of every step you take, and all of your general activity. When they were first produced, these devices were not very smart, and they did not have much power, but they were able to obtain a solid grasp at completing very simple tasks. Pedometers are what set off the inspiration for how fitness bands came about. The story of how these bands were developed is quite an impressive one. They are now able to provide quite a lot of features and applications. Though, the general public does not utilize them in a way that could be considered the full potential of their capabilities. Most users want to hit a certain amount of steps, or burn a certain amount of calories, and that’s about it.
The data that is provided by the types of bands we are currently discussing has the ability to be analyzed in such a way that would provide to the user the ability to deeply understand their day to day patterns and habits. Let’s say, for example, you happen to notice a band’s daily statistics, and see that the step count is lower than normal, you are then able to assume that someone is either sleeping or sedentary. The theoretical combination of the low amount of steps, along with other metrics, would be able to be calculated and provide you with the answer. But if we draw our attention to the steps taken by the user for the moment, you will come to notice that a majority of the time, individuals take on extremely similar patterns and habits. Their step count has the potential to be the same number every single time their day cycles. This is not an abnormal event, and in fact quite expected. With that information, we can construct a type of model that allows us the ability to have predictions of what the user is going to do. Let us say, for example, if a person is obligated to go to wherever they may work every morning at eight in the morning, for as long as they have that job, and go to it at the same time, the day that the step counting band does not rise in number during that time will give us the ability to make the determination that a break in the habit had happened. In order to gather more information, you are able to combine the step count with information such as the user’s heart rate. In today’s time, our fitness devices are able to display those markers, making it quite easily available. 
The user's heart beats per minute is even more powerful compared to the step counter. There are only a small number of moments that are able to be identified in the case of change of the heart rate. Either an individual is not sleeping and moving around, but not exercising, doing some sort of workout in the gym, or resting, lying down in bed. The last one out of that list is actually quite easily able to be identified. If you are able to correlate the heart’s beats per minute along with what the time of the day is, you are then able to assume that the individual is now sleeping with a good score for their confidence. There is another opportunity that the measurement of the heart’s beats per minute allows, which is to be able to identify if an individual is currently experiencing some sort of physical pressure, or under stress. By combining the two necessary ingredients, steps with the heart rate, you are then able to have a model that is quite accurate for any sort of activity one would be able to come up with. Let us say, for example, if the step count happens to be lower than normal, and the heart rate is lower than normal as well, it is quite easy to notice that the individual is not active, and in fact, sleeping. In the case of the heart rate being high but the step count being low, it is quite likely to be the user doing a gym exercise or on a treadmill. I have never in my life witnessed a person with low heart rate and a high step count,but I am able to infer that it would most likely be an athlete going for a run that does not have much impact on his or her heart’s beats per minute. 
The fear inducing possibility of making those pieces of technology gather more data than they did previously is noteworthy. The manufacturers have not used the entirety of the potential of the data that they are able to access. Instead of studying and taking notes on the information that they were able to gather, they have a tendency to rush into attaching even more sensors than they had before. Those sensors wind up not alwaying becoming the solution they are looking for. They happen to consume the device's battery fairly quickly, and so they have a chance of not being as ideal of an option as we may think it is. Though, it happens to be true that manufacturers need to have some sort of innovation in their products. But in my opinion, the innovation that really matters is making a product that has the ability to manipulate the data to talk, and actually being very good at using the technology that currently exists and allows you to keep moving and thinking forward. Having a comfortable and complete understanding of the basic technologies is a crucial element for the big companies of today. The brand new and shiny products that companies are distributing right now are not a real demonstration of the ways in which a company chooses to innovate. We have been able to make flexible screens for quite a large number of years, but the utilization of them as of right now has still yet to display any proof whatsoever. The department of Google that is mainly focused on innovation, which is called Google X, has come out with some nice pieces of tech from what they have done, though they can not be in any way, shape, or form usable by who they are attempting to sell products to. These actions do not lead to the future that is preferable for the sake of technological innovation, and the companies of our time should be more focused on the individuals they are attempting to directly sell their products to instead of how they look in terms of publicity. Those portions of the Internet of things are actually very useful for my interests. 
The solution is that they are simply required to be triaged. In today’s time there are now toothbrushes, umbrellas, refrigerators, dog collars, cat feeders, coffee machines, door locks, parking meters, mirrors, toys, and other rudimentary products that we use everyday that are connected. I do have difficulty in attempting to interpret what anyone would even want with an internet connected umbrella. The website states to the buyer that if you do not remember your umbrella while going outside in the rain, you then receive a notification. I am not sold in the slightest bit. This gives off the same idea with the internet connected pieces of luggage. While it is a helpful tool in the rare occasions you misplace your luggage, in order to know where it is, I am not certain if the hassle to implement that technology is worth how many times you will be using that function. There is a bit of large filtering to be accomplished in this area, causing the buyers of the products to begin to realize that not every item they buy should be connected to the internet, as there is very little to miss when you don’t have it. The other trend that has to do with internet connected pieces of technology is the artificial intelligence as well as machine learning. This, in my opinion, is the innovation that matters the most as long as rudimentary guidelines are listened to. The most important rule for an artificial intelligence to revolutionize the lifestyle or work habits of an individual is that the data it is collecting is not dirty in the slightest. There is a well known saying in the software industry that says “garbage in, garbage out.” Artificial intelligence is not a magic tool that has the ability to change everything on its own. It will help us in gradually understanding the exact amount of data that we have obtained and to make it easily readable for human beings. Artificial intelligence does not just complete tasks on its own. It is reliant on big data. Artificial Intelligence has been with us and within our tech since the nineteen fifties. One of the first ways people have applied artificial intelligence was through the invention of word processing following the scanning of a document. That happened to become a great technological development, but in this era there are not a great many documents that we are able to scan and that we would like to turn into text that is able to be processed. Though, that task has a specific reason for being that the artificial intelligence had the ability to tackle.

I was a child who struggled in math and it made me feel slow because I was not grasping the concept the way others wanted me to.

I understand it can be termed an ambitious goal that requires careful planning, innovation, and a passion for education. But I would want my elite school to take an advanced, progressive, and easy-to-grasp approach to encouraging children based on their individual needs. I would ensure that every child succeeds, regardless of their learning style or ability. Students do not have to be geniuses in order to succeed in school. The main purpose of the school would be to build the confidence of students in any area they struggle with. In addition to academic instruction, the school could also focus on building students' confidence and self-esteem. The age range of students in my school would be from six to twelve to start with. Personally, I want to start a school because of my experiences as a child. I was a child who really struggled in math, and it made me feel slow and incapable because I was not grasping the mathematical concept the way others wanted me to. There was no personalized support for someone like me. It would affect me negatively and make me feel bad. However, reading was my strong point, which gave me an edge. I felt confident about my skills when it came to reading. While other children could barely read chapter books and struggled with them, I was reading longer and bigger chapter books. That is why I like to call myself the Matilda of my day, since she was such an avid reader and so much like me.",Elaborate on the writer's dream of opening a school,elaborate

"As an expert in customer service, I have to say that giving the right attitude to customers all the time isn’t easy. But if you just keep wearing that smile and giving them that happy attitude they deserve, then it’ll get a lot easier for you. Whenever I was feeling at the end of my energy, and I really didn’t want to talk to anyone, or I was just simply in a bad mood, I just kept giving customers a smile and respect, and it made me feel better about it all. For me, making somebody feel better makes me feel better. I don’t know if that’s the case for you, but when I followed this mantra of just showing love and giving support to customers, the higher-ups saw me going above and beyond for the company, and they were impressed! They wanted to promote me and make me the face of the company whenever customers came in. I worked at a Wendy’s, and I had only been working there for about three months or so, and they were already going to promote me to crew trainer because I was so good with people. They figured I could train anybody, and I sure did. They always had me working the register so that I could talk to the customers, because if they were having a bad day and being short with the one taking their order, they’d always see me and change that attitude real quickly! They would be so happy to see me, all because I gave them respect and a smile on my face. It made working the job so much easier, not seeing the same lifeless faces come through the drive-thru everyday, but seeing smiles instead, and getting, “Hey! How you been?!” instead of just them handing me my money in silence. If you just give the customer something to work with, they’ll take that positive energy and shoot it right back at you. Of course you have some sticklers and the people who just gave up on human interactions, but you’ve got to lose some to win some, you know? To have this mindset isn’t so hard. You should just think about it from their point of view! Would you rather have somebody whojust doesn’t care at all, with a dead look in their eyes and nothing to say, or what I was talking about: a worker with purpose and something to say everytime you come up to the window, somebody that will engage when you haven’t had much engagement in the day? I’d rather have the second option. Of course, as I said, there are going to be some people who prefer the first option, but hopefully they’ll come around eventually. I remember there was a guy—I promise you his name was Jim Bob. He was always so grumpy—not like meh grumpy, but loud grumpy; let everybody around him know that he’s grumpy kind of grumpy. So one day I asked him, “Hey Jim, how was your day? Anything new happen?” and he said to me that he just got back from the hospital because his mother’s heart was failing, and she’d been dealing with this for a while now. I gave words of encouragement and comfort and a free drink to say, “Hope your day gets better!”. He came in the next day as happy as can be. This man had been grumpy all his life, but he came in with a smile on his face, asking me the same question I asked him the day before. He said his mother was doing better, that the talk we had yesterday really helped him out, and he’s been coming into Wendy’s really happy to see me ever since. It feels good because he was one of worst customers before. We dreaded seeing him come in, but now he’s a good ol’ regular. I only have a couple more stories like that, and they’re from other places where I’ve worked, and honestly, you probably don’t want to hear about them. They’re a little longer than that last one. But nonetheless, it’s a great way of making yourself and others feel happy, and I can’t stress enough how important it is for a business when you give their customers some really good customer service. They’ll always want to come back so that they can be treated nicely, and it gives you a little confidence boost. There’s a saying at one of my older jobs that, “you should leave your troubles at the door when you come into work.” I like that saying a lot because I’m so good at customer service because of it. It made me a better person; made me the man I am today because of that silly saying. I regret working at the job, but I don’t regret what I’ve learned from it. You know what? Have fun with it as well. Try to make some friends, why don’t you? Don’t try to give them your number or be too pushy, but whenever they come to visit, it should feel good to you; give you a little pep boost in the middle of the day. Going to work and seeing somebody you know there just makes it easier, don’t you think? I really do strongly feel that way. Whenever I’m working with my friends, I feel as if the day just goes by a lot faster. But all in all, customer service is more than just chores, an extra standard you have to tack onto the list of standards you already have for the company. It’s a way of life. You become a better speaker outside of work, and you get to talk to some people you may have thought were pretty interesting. Plus you make some new friends, which is always a nice bonus. But don’t forget, it also helps you out with the higher-ups! Getting promotions and good things like that is easy if you show you care about the company.","As an expert in customer service, I have to say that giving the right attitude to customers all the time isn’t easy. After all, we all have that rude customer that just immediately starts screaming at us right after we say hello. Or perhaps the customer that is unhelpful and will not provide any means for you to assist their plight. Also, we have to be wary of the pretend costumers that just try to scam us or someone else out of money.  But if you just keep wearing that smile and giving them that happy attitude they deserve, then it’ll get a lot easier for you. You’ll be able to let the negative interactions simply fade away. Whenever I was feeling at the end of my energy, and I really didn’t want to talk to anyone, or I was just simply in a bad mood, I just kept giving customers a smile and respect, and it made me feel better about it all. For me, making somebody feel better makes me feel better. It is yet again a reiteration of the that classic axiom: treat others how you want to be treated. I don’t know if that’s the case for you, but when I followed this mantra of just showing love and giving support to customers, the higher-ups saw me going above and beyond for the company, and they were impressed! By presenting myself always with a good mood, they wanted to promote me and make me the face of the company whenever customers came in. 
I worked at a Wendy’s, and I had only been working there for about three months or so, and they were already going to promote me to crew trainer because I was so good with people. In the end, that is the secret to costumer service isn’t? You simply have to be good with people, and you are destined to scale the ladder pretty high. They figured I could train anybody, and I sure did. I was able to instill a professionalism that did not simply excise one’s humanity from them. They always had me working the register so that I could talk to the customers, because if they were having a bad day and being short with the one taking their order, they’d always see me and change that attitude real quickly! If you can have such a positive influence with your customers that they feel better after speaking with you, then be sured that will come again since they felt human while acquiring a hamburger at lunch. They would be so happy to see me, all because I gave them respect and a smile on my face. Of course besides helping business to grow, it also starts to diminish the chances of getting a belligerent customer because they know you. It made working the job so much easier, not seeing the same lifeless faces come through the drive-thru everyday, but seeing smiles instead, and getting, “Hey! How you been?!” instead of just them handing me my money in silence. This made my own sprits happy, because it did not feel like a graveyard at my work anymore when someone smiles back at me. If you just give the customer something to work with, they’ll take that positive energy and shoot it right back at you.
While following the rules is important, do not act like a mindless robot that is just repeating the rules that were programmed into it. You follow the rules because they help clean make you-help Of course you have some sticklers and the people who just gave up on human interactions, but you’ve got to lose some to win some, you know? To have this mindset isn’t so hard. You should just think about it from their point of view! Simply putting yourself in their shoes could change everything. Would you rather have somebody who just doesn’t care at all, with a dead look in their eyes and nothing to say? Or would rather have what I was talking about: a worker with purpose and something to say every time you come up to the window, somebody that will engage when you haven’t had much engagement in the day? I’d rather have the second option. Of course, as I said, there are going to be some people who prefer the first option, but hopefully they’ll come around eventually. And I have someone in particular in mind when I say this. 
I remember there was a guy—I promise you his name was Jim Bob. He was always so grumpy—not like meh grumpy, but loud grumpy; let everybody around him know that he’s grumpy and not just kind of grumpy. So one day I asked him, “Hey Jim, how was your day? Anything new happen?” and he said to me that he just got back from the hospital because his mother’s heart was failing, and she’d been dealing with this for a while now. Now, as I hope you can see, I had found out the source of his grumpiness. Although I could not change his circumstances, I could smile at him and offer some reprieve from the hardship. I gave words of encouragement and comfort and a free drink to say, “Hope your day gets better!”. This particular attention, making him feel special, will have a reward. He came in the next day as happy as can be. This man had been grumpy all his life, but he came in with a smile on his face, asking me the same question I asked him the day before. He said his mother was doing better, that the talk we had yesterday really helped him out, and he’s been coming into Wendy’s really happy to see me ever since. It feels good because he was one of worst customers before. We dreaded seeing him come in, but now he’s a good ol’ regular. See? Didn’t I tell you that the positive energy will come back around? It can transform the worst costumers into one of your favorites. I only have a couple more stories like that, and they’re from other places where I’ve worked, and honestly, you probably don’t want to hear about them. They’re a little longer than that last one. I would not wish to bore all of you with repetitive stories. But nonetheless, it’s a great way of making yourself and others feel happy, and I can’t stress enough how important it is for a business when you give their customers some really good customer service. Of course, it is also really good for the costumer as my story just pointed out. They’ll always want to come back so that they can be treated nicely, and it gives you a little confidence boost. 
There’s a saying at one of my older jobs that, “you should leave your troubles at the door when you come into work.” I like that saying a lot because I’m so good at customer service because of it. It made me a better person; made me the man I am today because of that silly saying. I regret working at the job, but I don’t regret what I’ve learned from it. Just because you may not enjoy working or belong at the place you are currently employed does not mean you can not learn something form it. I did. You know what? Have fun with it as well. Try to make some friends, why don’t you? Don’t try to give them your number or be too pushy, but whenever they come to visit, it should feel good to you; give you a little pep boost in the middle of the day. Going to work and seeing somebody you know there just makes it easier, don’t you think? I really do strongly feel that way. Whenever I’m working with my friends, I feel as if the day just goes by a lot faster.  But all in all, customer service is more than just chores, an extra standard you have to tack onto the list of standards you already have for the company. It’s a way of life. You become a better speaker outside of work, and you get to talk to some people you may have thought were pretty interesting. Plus you make some new friends, which is always a nice bonus. But don’t forget, it also helps you out with the higher-ups! Getting promotions and good things like that is easy if you show you care about the company.",Expand on the writer/expert's opinion,elaborate
"If we can’t find a good storefront for a decent price, maybe we could start onlineand just do the baking from home at first.

"I teach everyday from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM, and then I am finished with my work day. That means that I can do whatever I want for the rest of the day. I can add additional classes with my second company, which also focuses on teaching ESL. The second company is open 24/7, so the earning potential is quite amazing. That means that I am making decent money online, with good hours, and can spend the rest of my day binge watching netflix, relaxing, spending time with family, or doing just about anything that I want.","I instruct my students on each day from six in the morning to ten in the morning. From that point on, I am finished with my work for that day. That becomes an indication of the fact that I am able to do whatever I would like for the entirety of the time I have left that day. There are some days that I may just watch television, or spend my time with family, but other days I make the decision to add in more classes with my second company, which is also primarily focused on teaching English as a Second Language. The second company is open for students twenty four hours, seven days a week, so the amount I would potentially be able to earn is quite amazing. I am also able to do it from anywhere, so if I would like to take a vacation, or have to go anywhere for any reason, I can ensure that I still have some sort of income. In turn, this means that I am able to earn a decent wage on the internet, with satisfactory hours of employment, along with the ability to spend the remaining time of my day binge watching television shows on netflix, letting myself relax, spending time with my family, or simply acting upon any feeling that I find suitable.","Describe more about working online, and this person's work day.",elaborate

"Your belief system runs your life. If you are unhappy, it is because your beliefs are causing your unhappiness. If you are happy, it is your beliefs that are causing your happiness. These beliefs are the blueprint to your life. Many new-agers today are touting self-development techniques, but they fail to include beliefs. You attend a seminar and you’re all excited and worked-up, but then you go home and all that juice is gone. Why? Because you still have those same beliefs that got you in that unwanted position in the first place. If you really want to change your life, change your beliefs. Well, you might say, “I believe that I should be promoted, but I’m not”. Well, I say you don’t believe that you should be promoted or you would be promoted already. I tell you that your beliefs are right in front of your face, you just have to clear your mind and read your thoughts, and you will change your life. You have taken on so many beliefs throughout your life from many different sources: your parents, your friends, your teachers, the media, etc. All of which are in your subconscious mind. These beliefs are unknown to you because you don’t see outside of yourself most of the time. These beliefs are second nature, and it is difficult for most people to be self-aware if they haven’t done the work. So, I recommend that think about what you want, and ask yourself, “what have I been told about myself and about what I want that would stop me from getting what I want?” Let me give you an example, let’s go back to that promotion. You write down what you want and then you start to think about the people that are in the position you want, but don’t have. You realize they have something special that you don’t, and that maybe they have more vocabulary, or they are more stylish, or they have better teeth, and you couldn’t ever possibly see yourself as good as them. Those would be an example of some beliefs that you hold that stand in the way of your dreams. The way to also identify your beliefs is by tracing your feelings. You want to pay attention to the way you feel when someone says something, or when you have a reaction to something or someone, that gives you an insight into yourself. Feelings are often regarded as a weakness in our society, but they serve a very important purpose in our lives. Feelings can be used as indicators, and when you used properly they can help to transform your life. Allow yourself to feel angry or upset and don’t push your feelings down to avoid processing them because they can tell you a lot about yourself. There is this saying that goes like this: “give me a boy until age seven and I will give you a man.” What do you think they mean when they say this? They are saying that the subconscious mind stays open like a sponge and soaks up information, especially anything said with strong feelings and accepts it as truth. The subconscious mind does not judge, so if you were told you are stupid at a young age, then you subconscious mind believes it. The quote is also saying that the maturity of your life is determined by what information is fed to you until age seven. Many people used to believe that a person can’t change, but we know differently now because the brain is capable of changing itself based on how the mind changes. So if you change your ideas or beliefs in your mind, your brain will change along with it. The reason why so many people get stuck is because they are unaware that they are creating their own lives, they think life is happening to them instead of for them. You are the captain of your ship, and until you start changing your beliefs by going inside and changing what you accepted as true, then nothing will change. You can also know this that we so not revisiti the past to judge, but we use it for interpretation and education. We use it to make connections with how we were in the past, and how that has created our present state today. You must also allow yourself to feel your feelings, because if you are out of touch with yourself to the extent that you don’t know how to feel your feelings then a surefire way to get in touch with yourself is to start asking yourself, “why did I do that”, or “why did I get mad at him like that”? Some beliefs may be more difficult to get rid of than others. That is because some beliefs are more deeply-embedded than others. Basically, it means that there are more layers to support that belief, so it is going to be more challenging and it will take more time to heal that belief than it would for a more superficial belief.  The thoughts in your head that cause you distress are indicators of what you believe, but they aren’t the exact beliefs. Beliefs can only clear as they come up, so the best way is to not waste any time and begin removing those beliefs. There are beliefs that were accepted at different levels of brainwave frequencies and they would be best cleared going back to that brainwave frequency. The four brainwave frequencies are: beta, alpha, theta, and delta. Beta is the awake state, alpha is the daydream state, theta is the drowsy state and delta is the sleep state. The less amount of consciousness you have, the closer you are to the subconscious mind so you can understand your beliefs or clear your beliefs. First, you must understand what they are, and then you can clear them. Many of the beliefs you have, you will find have to do with a lack of deserving this can mean a broad basis of beliefs. Self-love has been said to clear out many beliefs without having to know the exact beliefs. There are many routes to the same destination and a few have been presented here. What is important for you to know is that your beliefs are what run your life, and nothing else. Taking quiet time out everyday is a great way to clear out negative beliefs because it gives your body a break from being in a high state of stress all day long, and it allows your immune system to clear out those thoughts that are causing you so much stress. Food therapy is also another way of helping relieve stress. Just as a man becomes what he thinks, in the same way we are what we eat. There are many ways to heal yourself and your life, just choose one and don’t look back! If your choice hasn’t worked the way you like, you can just choose another method. Just keep going!","Your life centers upon your belief system. Each emotion is a reflection of your beliefs. Our beliefs mold how we interpret the world and subsequently influence our behavior. If you are feeling unhappy, it is a response to your views causing your unhappiness. Our beliefs set a foundation upon which we construct our lives, meaning that our views are the blueprint we live according to. Those who maintain new-age principles (new-agers) are trumpeting self-development techniques, but these techniques are not founded upon any belief system. Imagine this, you are present at a new-age seminar, and you are swayed by the message, feeling enthusiastic and rejuvenated, but afterward, you go home, and the fire has died.
Why does this happen? It's you because you still carry the same beliefs that brought you to the unwanted station you were in in the first place. If you desire actual change, the only correct course of action is to alter your beliefs. Well, you could say, ""I believe that I deserve to be promoted, but I haven't received a promotion."" Then I would respond by saying, ""I don't believe you deserve the promotion. Otherwise, you would already be promoted."" I'm saying this to inform you that your beliefs are right in front of you. You simply have to empty your mind and read your thoughts, and your life will subsequently change.
You have taken beliefs throughout your entire life from a multitude of different sources. These sources include your parents, teachers, friends, the media, favorite characters, favorite celebrities, etc. All of these are present in your subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is part of the mind that is not fully conscious but still affects thoughts, feelings, and behavior. It stores memories, emotions, and beliefs outside our conscious awareness. The subconscious mind processes information and influences behavior in ways that are not always apparent. A subconscious mind is a powerful tool for personal growth and self-improvement. It can reprogram negative beliefs and behaviors and promote positive life changes.
The beliefs that manifest from your subconscious mind are unknown to you because you do not have the ability to perceive yourself from an outside source. These views are second nature. It is difficult for anyone to become self-aware if they have not done the work. An excellent place to start is by reflecting on what you want and asking yourself, ""What have people told me about myself? What have they told me about what I want? What would stop me from getting what I want?"" I'm going to give you an example. Let's go back to the promotion that I was talking about earlier. You write down what you want, and then you begin to think about people who are in the position that you want to be in. You recognize that they have something special that you do not have. For instance, maybe they have a better vocabulary, or perhaps they dress more fashionably, or they have nicer and healthier teeth, and you feel as if you could never be as good as them. Those are all examples of beliefs that would stand in the way of you fulfilling your dreams.
Another method to identify your belief system is to trace your feelings. You want to pay attention to how you emotionally react when someone says something or how you respond to someone or something that provides insight into yourself. Our society often considers sensitivity towards feelings as a weakness, but they play a vital role in our lives. Feelings can be used as markers, and when correctly identifying the way those markers indicate emotions, we can truly change how we are living. Allow yourself to embrace your incoming feelings. Open up to feeling upset or mad, and do not ignore what you are feeling by avoiding processing your emotions because they tell you a lot about who you really are. 
A valuable saying goes like this: ""if you give me a child until he turns seven years old, I will give you back a man."" What does this saying mean? It states that the subconscious mind remains open and absorbs information like a sponge, particularly things communicated with strong feelings that one accepts as the truth. You will receive no judgment from the subconscious mind. If someone tells you that you are dumb when you are young, then you will subconsciously believe what has been said to you. The previously mentioned quote also states that the maturity of your life is determined by the information you receive until you become seven years old. A lot of people used to be under the impression that people cannot change, but now we know that's not true because the brain has the ability to alter itself as a response to how the mind changes. Therefore, if you change your views or ideas in your mind, your brain will adequately adjust. 
The reason why so many people are not able to progress is that they are not aware that they are molding their own lives. They are under the impression that life is happening to them instead of for them. You're the captain of your ship, the pilot of your plane, and you chart your own course. Until you journey inward to change your beliefs and alter what you previously accepted as truth, then nothing will truly change. You should also be aware that we should not revisit the past with judgment as our intention. Instead, we should interpret history so that it may educate and influence our future. The past is a tool we can use to make connections about who our former selves were. We cannot revisit the past to create new judgments but use it to learn and adjust our perceptions. We can use it to connect to who we used to be and how that journey has brought us to our present selves. 
You have to let yourself feel what you're feeling. If you're out of sync with yourself, then a foolproof method of returning to yourself is to ask, ""Why did I do that?"" or ""Why did I get so upset with him?"" Some beliefs are more challenging to dispose of than others. That's because some views are deeper in us than others. It means there are more layers to support that belief, so it will be more complex and will take longer to recover than it would for a more exterior view.
Things that make you feel stressed are markers of what you believe, but they aren't exact. Beliefs can only become clear as they are encountered, so the best thing to do is not to waste a second and dispose of those beliefs. Some views were accepted at different brainwave frequencies and are best eliminated by returning to that frequency. The four frequencies are beta, alpha, theta, and delta. Beta is the awake state, alpha is the daydream state, theta is the exhausted state, and delta is the sleep state. The less conscious you are, the closer you are to your subconscious mind, and you'll better understand your beliefs and get rid of them. Many of your beliefs concern a sense of undeserving, which can mean various things. Self-love is thought to eliminate many views without knowing what they are. There are a lot of paths to the same place, and some are mentioned here. You must understand that your life is centered on your beliefs, and that's it. 
Have a silent period each day. It's an excellent method for clearing negative beliefs because it relieves stress and lets your immune system clear out stress-inducing thoughts. Taking a silent period each day can benefit your mental and emotional well-being. It can help reduce stress and anxiety by providing a calm and relaxing environment that allows you to disconnect from the constant noise and stimulation of the outside world. A silent period can enhance your focus and productivity by giving you a break from the distractions and interruptions that impede your progress. This quiet space can help you concentrate on your tasks and increase efficiency. It can also increase your self-awareness by enabling you to understand your thoughts and emotions better. By tuning in to your inner voice, you can identify areas of your life that may need attention and make positive changes. Silence can inspire creativity and innovation. In a quiet space, your mind can wander, and you may discover new ideas and solutions to problems you may not have considered before. Incorporating a silent period into your daily routine can positively affect your mental and emotional well-being, productivity, and relationships. Whether it's a few minutes of quiet reflection, a meditation session, or a walk in nature, taking time for silence can be a valuable investment. 
You can also ease stress through food therapy. Food therapy is a natural approach to stress management that uses specific foods and nutrients to help alleviate stress and promote relaxation. You must choose foods that contain stress-reducing nutrients such as B vitamins, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids. These can be found in leafy greens, nuts and seeds, fish, and whole grains. It's also essential to avoid or limit stimulants like caffeine and sugar as they can increase feelings of anxiety and stress. Choosing alternatives like herbal tea or water promotes relaxation. Also, mindful eating is another form of food therapy. It involves paying attention to the sensations and flavors of your food, which can help you slow down and savor your meals, aiding you in becoming one with your sensations. Just like a man becomes what he thinks, he also becomes what he eats. There are many avenues to hear yourself and life. Choose one and keep pushing. If your choice doesn't work how you intended, choose another. Just don't stop!",Elaborate on how changing your beliefs can improve your life,elaborate

"Viscometers allow the measurement of the viscosity of a solution. There are various types of viscometers used in laboratories, but one of the most simple is the Ostwald viscometer. The principle of a viscometer is as follows: the time taken for a sample to flow down a narrow capillary between two marker lines is measured. This time is compared to the time taken for water to flow between the same lines. By dividing these two times, relative viscosity can be determined. A viscometer must use a narrow capillary to ensure that the viscous properties of the fluid are influential on the flow time. A wide capillary would mean that the inertial forces are larger than the viscous forces, making the flow turbulent. More complex viscometers use multiple capillaries and allow for the determination of kinematic viscosity. Viscometers are incredibly important to the chemical industry, in particular with fuels. A fuel’s viscosity must be known precisely at a wide range of temperatures, so that it can be transported and used safely. A large change in viscosity with temperature could lead to unexpected behaviour, for example, in an engine, which could be dangerous.","Viscometers are technological devices that allow for the precise measurement of how viscous a solution is. There is a wide variety of viscometers that scientists are able to utilize within their laboratories, but out of all of them, an example of the most rudimentary, and elementary is the Ostwald viscometer, which works on the principle of Poiseuille’s Law. But the principle purpose of any viscometer is as follows: the measurement of time it takes for a sample of a specific substance to flow the entirety of itself all the way down a narrow capillary between a set of two parallel marker lines. This measured amount of time is then put up against the time taken for the simple solution of one hydrogen and two oxygen to flow the entirety of itself between the same parallel marker lines. By splitting both of these two times, the relative viscosity then has the ability to be calculated and exactly determined. A viscometer is required to utilize a capillary that is narrow in order to make certain that the viscous properties of whatever fluid is being measured have a sufficient amount of influence on the time it takes for the substance to flow. A capillary that is wider would indicate that the forces of inertia are much larger than the forces that are viscous, which would then be forcing the flow to become turbulent. More complex viscometers make use of a large number of capillaries and also allow for the determination of kinematic viscosity (as opposed to dynamic viscosity, which is what this is). Viscometers are incredibly important to the specific individuals that choose to involve themselves in the industry of chemicals, in particular with fuels. A fuel’s viscosity is required to be known precisely even at a wide range of temperatures that it could possibly be exposed to. This in order for it to be transported, bought, sold, and used safely, which is really important if you are transporting fuel to, say, Alaska. If viscosity starts to rapidly change due to the temperature, it has a chance of leading to very unexpected and volatile behavior, for instance, let us say, in an engine, which has a chance of being extremely dangerous. As soon as that engine tries to consume that fuel, one can assume that only bad things can occur.",Describe more about viscometers.,elaborate
"Today, I will be talking about the trip I took to London with my three other friends. At first we decided how to get there without having to pay anything at all. We researched the cheapest price to get to London and back without using any expensive public transports, such as the train or a national express bus. Our aim was to get the transport as low as ten dollars per person round-trip. Finally, we decided to meet at my home and research into the transport. After that, we had a talk about how to plan the journey back to London. It was three of my friends and myself. It was a perfect getaway after all the coursework and exams at the end of the first semester of my master’s program. Finally, we decided to take Megabus to  Victoria Coach Station in London. We found cheap tickets as low as five dollars for a single ticket per person and, for a return, four dollars per person. We were happy with this decision to go to London using Megabus. The bus stop is close to my home, approximately a fifteen-minute walk away. After that, we discussed what type of activities we should go for. For example, which museums should we visit? My friends have never seen the London Eye or other famous London areas. So we asked Google for a quick tips on how to get the best service we can on our journey. After that, we found the five top places to visit in London, which are the London Eye, a few other good museums, and some parks. So we settled in and went for an early night’s rest because our itinerary started at 6 a.m. We would get to London within two hours. From there, we went straight to the nearest food chain where we could get some good-quality breakfast for a good price. We went to some local London cafe where we had coffee and some other snacks. After that, we went for a walk to Buckingham Palace. It took fifteen to thirty-five minutes of walking, with several stops along the way to look around on the way to the Palace. From there, we had a look at the Palace. It was incredibly beautiful and we all enjoyed it. We all took several photos at the Palace and shared them across Facebook and Instagram so that our friends back home in Coventry can view them. From there, we had a walk around the Palace and read every quote we could find which highlights the importance of this palace. From there, we had a walk to local places such as Big Ben and had the opportunity to take a picture in front of it. We also took a picture in front of the famous London Eye. Unfortunately, we could not enter the London Eye because it was closed for a week due to repairs. But that didn’t stop us. We took several pictures of the London Eye and we all moved on. By then, we had walked about five miles and we were all tired. So we decided to get some good fast food. We met at a local London Chinese food place that specializes in noodles. We liked the place, but not the price. At that moment, a single package of noodles cost eight dollars and extra 2.50 for a drink. So we had a talk and we all decided to capitalize on this fabulous offer. Then, we all ordered three different varieties of noodles from this shop. One friend ordered a vegetarian option, another friend ordered chicken and beer, and I ordered chicken, pork, and beef with a Coca-Cola along with it. We paid approximately around twelve dollars each. We were not happy with the price we paid, but we figured it was for the experience. It took us a good forty minutes to finish the food. Two of my friends couldn’t finish the food due to excess food and if was covered in oil and little bit spicy. So I ate their food, too, except for the vegetarian option because I prefer meat. Then, we went past several other stops, such as museums. One of the museums we went to is called the British History Museum. It was huge in size and we all liked the entrance. In the entrance there was a guy selling beautiful old-style cashew nuts, which we all bought since they only cost two dollars per pack. From there, we went inside the museum and it was beautifully designed. We all liked it and its diverse range of collections. We all went our separate ways. I went to the Egyptian collection, my friend went to the African collection and another friend went to the Asian collection. It took a good three hours for us to meet up after the museum, but it was worth it and we all liked it. We all had a rest and came up with the idea to just to see a local movie for a while before we figure out what to do next. Then, we carried on moving and going to places that seemed interesting to us so that we could take good pictures and move on. From there, we went to a different theater or museum that was showing an  art collection. It was a great art collection and we all liked it. And it only took us twenty minutes to view this art collection because of its boring acts. We didn’t like it and we moved on walking to the other parts of thestreet. It was great, but the day was getting short. We all want to go to KFC to find good food for a bargain. From there, we waited for a bus service . It took us a good twenty minutes to get to the nearest KFC restaurant. We liked it.","Today, I will be speaking on the excursion I took to London with three acquaintances of mine. Initially we determined a way to arrive there without needing to purchase much at all. We looked up the least expensive rate to arrive in London and back without using any costly public transportation, like the train or a national express bus. Our goal was to buy transportation for as little as ten dollars for each person there and back. Finally, we made the decision to gather at my house and study up on transit. Then we discussed the plan of action for our excursion back to London. The vacation was a great idea following all the schoolwork and tests during the closing days of the first semester of my master’s program. Lastly, we made the decision to ride the Megabus to Victoria Coach Station in London. We were able to discover low-price tickets that only asked for five dollars per person, and four dollars per person for returning. We were happy to go to London using Megabus. The bus stop is reachable from my home, with only a fifteen minute walk in between. After we went there, we talked about the kind of ventures we should try to find. For instance, what museums are available for us to visit? My acquaintances haven’t had the chance to see the London Eye or other well known London places. So we looked up quick tips on Google regarding how to get top notch service on our trek. Then, we discovered the five best areas to visit in London, the London Eye, some museums, and a number of parks. So we went to bed early because our schedule began at 6 a.m. We’d arrive in London within two hours. From there, we made a beeline to the closest food chain that vended some good standard breakfast for a decent rate. We found a local London cafe that supplied us with coffee and other snacks. Afterwards, we walked to Buckingham Palace. It was a fifteen to thirty-five minute walk, with a number of stops along the way for observance sake. From there, we took a gander at the Palace. It was amazingly gorgeous and we were pleased with it. We took a number of pictures at the Palace and shared them on Facebook and Instagram for our friends in Coventry to view. From there, we walked around the Palace, found and read every quote that presented the palace’s importance. Next, we walked to community places like Big Ben and were able to take a photo in front of it. We also took a photo at the front end of the well-known London Eye. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get into the Eye because it was shut down for repairs for the week. Though, we weren’t hitting the brakes because of it. We took photos of the Eye, then moved on. By then, we had walked about five miles and the fatigue was setting in. So we made the decision to buy some solid fast food. We gathered at a local Chinese food restaurant with a noodle specialization. We enjoyed the establishment, but not the rate. The place charged eight dollars for a single package of noodles and an extra two fifty for a drink. So we decided to make the best of this great deal. So, we all requested three different types of noodles from this establishment. One acquaintance requested a vegetarian version, another requested chicken and beer, and I requested chicken, pork, and beef with a Coca-Cola. We paid about twelve bucks each. We weren’t pleased with the rate, but summed up that it was for the journey. It took a solid forty minutes to eat. Two of my friends couldn’t finish the food because it was covered in oil, a little bit spicy and too much food in general. So I ate their meal as well, besides the vegetarian version because I’d rather have meat. Next, we passed a number of other stops, like museums. One of them was the British History Museum. It was huge, and we all enjoyed the entrance, because there was a man vending pretty old-style cashew nuts, which we all purchased because the rate was two bucks a pack. From there, we went inside to see the beautiful design. We enjoyed it and the wide range of collections. We all dispersed throughout the building. I found myself in the Egyptian collection, my acquaintance was in the African collection and another went to the Asian one. It took a solid three hours for us to gather after looking through the museum, but it was a worth-while experience. We rested and had the idea to simply watch a local movie for a time prior to figuring out what to do next. Afterward, we kept moving and traveling to areas that looked engaging to us so that we could shoot solid photos and carry on. From there, we traveled to a separate theater or museum that was presenting an art collection. It was an amazing collection, and it only took twenty minutes to view it due to the unentertaining acts. We kept on strolling to the other portions of the road. It was amazing, but the day did not have much time. We all wanted to go to KFC to find a solid meal for a good rate. From there, we waited for a bus. It took us a solid twenty minutes to travel to the closest KFC establishment. We enjoyed it.",Paraphrase this text,paraphrase

"Throughout my experience in the entertainment industry, I have become an expert in costume design for the stage. One of the most important parts of being a costume designer is communication. A designer must effectively communicate with all members of the design team for each production he is a part of, not to mention effective communication with the director of the production. In the past four years, I have  designed costumes for children’s theatre, big-budget theatres, and small professional theaters. One of the most important things to start with when you are designing a play is the script. I find that I must read the script at least three times before I can even start to think about the costumes. The first read is to understand the story. Read the play as if you are an audience member experiencing the play for the first time. I find that not thinking about anything, but plot the first time through helps me to experience a fresh take on the play and identify personal thoughts and feelings that I experience while reading. The second read is to look for deeper meanings. This is when I will start to analyze subtextual meanings, symbolism, and relationships. I am still not thinking about the costumes at this point, only about the greater meaning of the work. The third read is when I will start to think about the challenges a script presents, such as quick changes, double-castings, and other unique scenarios that would present a problem with the design. After this, I am ready to attend the first design meeting with the director and the rest of the design staff. In the first meeting between the designers, director, assistant directors, and stage managers, think about the particular elements you want to bring out within the context of the play. For instance, a director may want to emphasize the relationship between siblings, or the importance of clear communication. The most important thing at this stage is to make sure that whatever you are trying to bring out is in the play. There is nothing worse than a production when the director has forced a concept on a story that it doesn’t belong in. I, personally, have seen many productions in which a director has created a product that could have been great, but is instead tedious, because the entire time I’m thinking about how the concept makes no sense within the story. After the team has discussed the conceptual piece of the play, the concerns with the script must be addressed. It is not important to figure out solutions to these issues at the moment; it is more of a chance to voice them to the room for advice, comments, and brainstorming. After this meeting, a designer is ready to start doing their research. Research comes in all shapes and sizes when it comes to costume design. For some plays, it may mean looking at microfilm in the library to understand a certain historical event. For others, it may mean looking at recent apparel adds to research fashion trends. More often than not, I do my research almost exclusively online, as the internet is an effective platform to share your research with anyone involved, such as the director or an assistant designer. I generally create a folder on a cloud storage platform for each show, and use that folder as a dumping ground for any images I come across that interest me. This way, I have research images for any renderings that I may draft, and I have reminders of my thought processes in case I cannot remember why I thought of a particular solution or piece. It is important to remember throughout all stages of the design that there is no right answer. Though there may be a wrong answer, there isn’t one specific way to do things. After I gather all of my research, I will usually put specific images together in a PowerPoint document with a slide for each character. This will include the character’s general color palette and a sense of the pieces a character would have in their closet. Ideally, after this stage, the designer and the director are on the same page on the ideas being represented by each character. However, if they are not on the same page, it should become apparent by the director's reaction to the research. This is also a good time to catch up on the research of another designer in the room to make sure the production is moving in a cohesive direction. After this, I usually like to read the script again to remind myself of everything I’ve thought about thus far. In this read, I will usually comb through to find any mention of specific pieces in the dialogue. For instance, if the characters are all talking about someone’s red dress, I need to make sure that the character is in a red dress. After this, I will start line drawing. A line drawing indicates the shape of the garments you intend to design without bringing color into the picture. If a designer would like, they can also present a color pallette, but it is not necessary. This way, the director of the production can approve piecesor steer the designer in a new direction with alternative feedback. After this meeting, everyone on the design team ideally knows essentially what the show will look like. This is when a designer can start adding color to the rendering. I usually color my renderings with watercolor, because that is what I was taught in school. At the final meeting, the designers will present final designs and hopefully get approval from the director. If not, there may be an issue with the research or with the interpretation of the play. After this is done, the designer will start to pull pieces from stock, buy new pieces, or build new pieces.","I have developed significant expertise in stage costume design throughout my career in the entertainment industry. Communication is vital to successful costume design. To effectively do their job, a designer must be able to communicate with every person on the design team in addition to the production’s director. Over the last four years, I have designed costumes for theatres big and small, including children’s theatres. One of the most important starting places for any play is the script. I usually do not even begin to think about costume design until I have read the script at least three times. The first readthrough is for understanding the play as if I were an audience member enjoying the play for the first time. Keeping my mind clear of all but the plot helps me look at the play from fresh perspectives and identify my surface-level reactions to the work. The second readthrough is done with an eye for deeper meaning, analyzing subtexts, symbolism, and other relationships. Costumes still have not entered my mind; the focus is entirely on the work's deeper meanings. The third readthrough is devoted to analyzing the script for costume and timing challenges, such as quick changes, double–castings, and other special situations that might prove tricky about design. After completing this, I am prepared to attend the first design meeting with the director and the design team. The initial meetings between the designers, managers and directors are to consider the individual elements you wish to highlight within the context of the play. A director may wish to emphasize things like the relationship between a pair of siblings or the importance of direct communication. The most important part of this stage is to emphasize whatever that chosen facet of the play is. Nothing is worse than when a director forces a concept on a production that doesn’t belong. I have personally witnessed many productions that could have been excellent but instead fell short and became tedious because a central concept did not fit within the overall context of the play. After introducing the concepts, the team begins to discuss the script. It is not vital that solutions to potential issues be presented immediately, only that they be pointed out and discussed. Designers are ready to begin their research after this meeting is complete. That research can take many forms; for some, it involves historical research in a library setting, and for others, it may include studying recent fashion trends. I conduct most of my research online, as the internet is a powerful tool for sharing research with other design team members. I usually create a folder on a cloud-based storage system and fill it with interesting images and information. This streamlines the cataloging process and helps me keep my thoughts organized. It is important to note that there are no “right” answers during the design stage. While there may be incorrect answers, there is no one correct answer to design questions. After completing my research, I typically create a PowerPoint presentation based on the character designs I have in mind. Each slide includes different details about a character, such as a character’s overall color palette and clothing options. At this point, the director and designer are ideally on the same page concerning the design of each character. The director’s reaction to the research will indicate whether or not they are on the same page. At this point, I typically confer with other designers and read through the script another time. This reading is done with special attention paid to details in dialogue referencing wardrobe items. For instance, if a character mentions someone wearing a red dress, I will ensure that the character wears a dress that color. I then begin to draw the outlines of the garments without color. A color palette can be introduced at this stage, but it is unnecessary. This gives the director and other designers more opportunities to change the designs. At that point, everyone generally agrees upon the characters’ designs, and a designer can add color to the drawings. I typically use watercolors since that is how I was trained. The director typically approves these watercolors at the final meeting. If not, there has been some issue during the research and design process. Then the director will utilize, purchase, and construct the necessary pieces.",Paraphrase this,paraphrase

"It is important to choose an appropriate lab for the occasion when setting out to design an inquiry-based unit. Some labs that require specialized equipment that needs detailed instructions in order to understand how it is operated may not be a good choice for this type of activity. An inquiry-based lab is better suited as an exploratory introduction to a chapter, instead of a detailed rigorous data collection study. Inquiry-based labs can be integrated into almost all physics units, even those that intuitively do not make sense at first. For example, when beginning to teach a unit on Newton’s law of universal gravitation, it is difficult to get students to understand a concept that they cannot see. The laws of gravity that hold the universe together are invisible to students, and they cannot begin to comprehend a force of gravity different than that experienced between themselves and their own planet. Trying to go over advanced calculations for other planets can be a boring and unrewarding task for them. However, giving each lab group an open-ended question in the guided-inquiry format can be a very effective means of opening up their minds to this new chapter. NASA and other educational non-profits have online tools that students can explore to simulate gravity on other planets. With a lab notebook in hand, students should be given some online resources and a general question, such as “What color would the sky be on Mars?” or “How would it feel to run and jump on the surfaces of other planets?” Using online computer simulations is an extremely effective way of engaging students in following their own lines of inquiry in a focused way that is also exposing them to the content. Computer-based learning also has the distinct advantage of allowing different groups of learners to discover and learn at various places.","It is vital to select a suitable lab when designing an inquiry-based unit. Certain labs that need specialized equipment which require exhaustive instructions to build an understanding of how it operates are potentially an ill-suited selection for tasks such as this. An inquiry-based lab is a preferred fit as an experimental introduction to a chapter and as an alternative to a comprehensive data collection study. Inquiry-based labs are capable of integration with nearly all physics units, even ones that are not naturally understandable at first. Consider this, when instruction concerning Newton’s law of universal gravitation is underway, it is hard to empower students to grasp an immaterial concept. Gravitational laws that bind the universe together cannot be seen by students, and they are unable to understand a force of gravity other than that known between themselves and their own planet. Attempting to examine advanced calculations for other planets can prove dull and unfruitful for students. Nevertheless, providing each lab group with an open-ended question in the guided-theory format has the potential to be an efficient path to increase their understanding of this new chapter. NASA and other educational non-profits have online resources that students can use to replicate gravity on other planets. With notetaking means, students should receive online resources and a broad question, like, “What color would the sky be on Mars” or “How would it feel to run and jump on the surfaces of other planets?” Employing online computer simulation is an efficient method to capture students’ attention and divert their focus to exploring their own inquiries in unison with the content. Computer-based learning also benefits from allowing differing sects of students to learn and study at a variety of places.",Paraphrase,paraphrase
"The second reason that athletes are not successful at tryouts is because they have not perfected the skills that they do have. Even if a kid has been practicing their new skill all year long and they feel that they are able to perform that skill at tryouts, it is often the skills that they have been doing for years that hold them back. A kid can throw a perfect back handspring at tryouts, but if they have not taken the time to perfect their back walkover or front walkover, we will be less likely to place that kid on a level two team, because we need to see them perfect the skills for level one first. This is not meant to hold kids back, but rather encourage them to perfect their skills before moving up in difficulty. This also ensures that they will be able to continue to move up in difficulty, because they have mastered the basics. At all levels, it is important to have the skills from previous levels, because they will still be utilized. It is also important to have these skills because it will make it much easier to learn more difficult skills in the future. Everything comes down to body awareness and control.

"Today we are going to talk about the music industry. Over the years, the music industry has changed drastically. Going from record and CD stores to everything being completely digital has opened up new doors to many different opportunities, but also shut doors for many companies. In the early 2000s, there were CD stores, record stores, and video stores littering every strip and plaza across the US. Slowly, those stores began to diminish due to digital stores and sites such as Limewire, iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, and now YouTube Music. To say that the digital age has had an effect on this would be an understatement. Children who were born in the late ‘90s and early 2000s spearheaded this digital advancement. Not only were music stores affected, but video stores were affected as well. How long has it been since we’ve even heard about Blockbuster? Netflix has also gone completely digital now. In the past, they used to send out DVDs monthly to their subscribers. This all has to do with ease of access. Not only as Americans, but as humans, we like to find an easy way out of situations and we love when things are available right then and there at our fingertips. It allows us to save our time and spend it on something more important. Being able to unlock your mobile device and/or sign onto your laptop and have the world literally at your fingertips allows for less time to be spent getting in your car and driving to the store to purchase what you were looking for. This, however, was very bad for physical stores. A huge financial decline ensued, as more and more people began to convert to the digital stores. Imagine this: You spend so much money on renting or leasing a business, then to acquire the product, and also to publicize your business for several years, just for some digital store to take all of your customers. Something that you’ve worked on for a very long time has been uprooted by a program that was just created in the span of a year. Financially, you’re struggling, so you have to eventually close down your shop and find something else to bring in the big bucks. Although there are still a few physical shops out there, they are mainly for older generations who still own the devices to play back the material. Most youth from this generation wouldn’t even know how a Walkman worked, even if the instructions were right next to them. At the rate that physical stores were going out of style, so were the playback devices. From Walkmans to CD players, MP3 players, and handheld radio devices, they are rarely seen today. You can now access the material you want to listen to or watch and the playback device within one console: a laptop, tablet, iPad, or other mobile device. This saves us, the consumers, money as well. Instead of having to spend money on the material and the device, we make a one-time payment on the device and several small payments on the material. Unfortunately, this has made us lazier. Movie nights, binge watching, and TV series have allowed for us to be more stagnant in the work that we do everyday if we let them. We have to motivate ourselves to get physical throughout the day when everything is, again, at our fingertips. Most physical store owners were not left behind. After realizing that those stores were no longer a necessity, they began investing in their own competition. This allowed them to reap the benefits of what the competitor is making and receiving.","Today we will speak about the music industry. Throughout the years, the music industry has altered incredibly. Progressing from record and CD shops to everything being totally digitized has allowed a bunch of different opportunities, but also closed down many companies. In the early 2000s, there were CD shops, record shops, and video shops covering every strip and plaza throughout America. Gradually, those shops started to decline because of digital shops and websites like Limewire, iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, and now YouTube Music. Saying the digital age had an effect on this wouldn’t do it justice. Children that grew up in the late‘90s and early 2000s lead this digital progress. Not only were music shops affected, but video shops too. How long has it been since someone uttered anything about Blockbuster? Netflix is also totally digitized. Before, they shipped DVDs to their subscribers every month. This is all because of convenience. As Americans, but also as humans, we enjoy finding easy ways out of situations and extremely enjoy when things are available to us any time we want. It lets us save time and spend it on what’s more pertinent. Having the ability to unlock your cellphone and/or log onto your laptop and have everything you could want to know before you lets less time be spent getting in your vehicle and traveling to the shop to buy the thing you were searching for. This, though, was not good for tangible shops. A giant fiscal reduction started happening, as more individuals started to transfer to the digitized shops. Picture this: You spend a lot of funds on renting or leasing a company, then to obtain the product, and also to market your company for a number of years, just for some digitized shop to seize all your consumers. Something that you’ve labored on for an extremely long time has been diminished by a computer application that was created within a year. Fiscally, you’re going through hardships, so you must eventually shut down your shop and discover something else to get the cheddar. Though there are still a small number of tangible shops, they are mostly for older people that still have the devices and want to play the material. Most young people from this generation wouldn’t even understand the functionalities of a Walkman, even if the directions were beside them. At the speed that tangible shops were becoming antiquated, as were the playback gadgets. From Walkmans to CD players, MP3 players, and handheld radio gadgets, it is hard to come across one today. You can now find the media you want to hear or watch along with the playback device inside a single console: a laptop, tablet, iPad, or other mobile device. This helps us, the buyers, cash too. Rather than spending money on the media and the gadget, we pay for the device one time, and make several small payments on the media. Sadly, we’ve become more gluttonous because of it. Movie nights, binge watching, and TV series have led us to be more motionless in the labor we do everyday if we allow them. We must prompt ourselves to move throughout the day when everything is, to repeat myself, available to us any time we want. Most tangible shop owners weren’t abandoned. After discovering that those shops weren’t a necessity anymore, they started putting money into their own competitors. This lets them take in the benefits of what the competitor is creating and getting.","rewrite, reword and reorganize",paraphrase
"An example of this is as follows: Imagine a customer is on a two-part rate and used 1000 kWh on average during the time period, so that is their baseline.  Prior to the time period, the customer receives notification that the marginal rate is $2/kWh because of a flood at the generation site. The standard rate is $0.15/kWh, so they will pay $0.15 * 1000, or $15 for the base rate. But then anything over that amount gets very expensive ($2/kWh), so they will not want any additional usage. (For example, if they added an assembly line, it could cost them thousands to run it.) But if they shut down totally and are in a two-part rate that provides rebates, they will then get a credit of almost $2000 for that period!

"Also known as Scrum, agile development is a form of project management used to develop products. This methodology is different from the standard methodology, which is waterfall. In waterfall, there is a “gate 2” at the start (and end) of each development phase. The various phases in waterfall are requirements gathering, testing, development (programming), and deployment. In contrast to Agile, waterfall doesn’t not have rollbacks.: Once a stage is complete, there is no way of modifying it. That has frequently been considered a disadvantage. On the other hand, in Agile, there are multiple iterations during which one can mouify requirements. The goal of Agile is to develop a deployable application by the end of every iteration (also called a “sprint”). Each sprint is usually comprised of a two week period. In Agile(which is also known as Scrum), there is a constant feedback loop. The principles of Agile development can be found in the Agile Manifesto which is found online.  The sifferent Agile methodologies are: Scrum (most popular), Scrum illustration, Scrum roles, Scrum ceremonies, Scrum (daily), sprint demo, and Scrum artifacts. When does one use Agile over waterfall? When one has to quickly develop a project in a domain where there is already a lot of work done. In comparison, waterfall can be used whenit’s actually the other way around. Another type of agile development is Lean (LEAN), which commonly uses Kanban boards. These are boards that have different stages (like To Do, In Progress, Done), and everyone is assigned to that project, to a certain task. In Agile there is also what is called retrospectives, which are a way to keep the team up to date with what has been done. In Retros, as they are commonly called, there are many different methods to do this. For example, a common method is to use Post-it notes to create three categories: mad, sad, glad. very person has to write a few things they are mad/sad/glad about, then the master of ceremonies tells everyone to put the notes up on the board and he groups the common topics together. Then there is a round of voting, which is done by the “dots” method, in which everyone gets two to three dots. They vote on one of the topics, then the Scrum master of ceremonies writes or discusses the topics in order of priority. Another commonly done thing is the “ball” method, which works by giving a ball to someone in the team,then only the person that holds the ball can talk about the problems or events in the team. The other team members can ask for the ball by having their hand raised, and the ball is passed in a circle to the person on the right or just by selecting someone with their hand up. Retros are good because they help analyse the outcome of a sprint. They also help to prioritize important topics. This is called timeboxing. Teams can often get bored of doing the same Retro method every week, so the team has to keep the Retro method fresh every week, or every two weeks. Agile is commonly used for test-driven development, Test-driven development is a way of developing by writing tests before you write any code. When the code is compiled, the tests are run against it, and you know which tests run and which don’t, which gives a good idea of how to do the test. In Java, a common thing to use to write tests is called JUnit, and there are four versions.JUnit 4 is the most commonly used one at the moment. Other tools are like Docker and Mockito help with writing mock tests. For example, you need a database and  you don’t actually have a database, but you have some code that uses a database. You can create a mock of the database without actually making a database, because making databases is very tedious, That’s an example. Another example is using coded completion in IDEs. This is done by scanning the libraries of the programming language. Test-driven development is also used to keep track of good code in Git or Git-like programs, because every time someone commits, the tests are passed, and you can see who commited what and if it runs or not. An advantage of this, which is called continuous integration, is that when you are commiting code at least daily, you can always have the option to rollback to the last version of the program that was properly running. Other examples of Git-like programs are Jenkins and Bamboo. Do note that Git is for GitLab and GitHub. They are not different versions of Git, they are just web portals that belong to different companies, but they still use Git on the backend. When one comes across Agile and Git, one is also taught all about web services and REST. REST is a universal API standard which tells programs how to transmit things so that they are standardised. For example, JSON is a very global form of transmitting data. Virtually any modern programming language uses JSON to transfer data between different environments, like between a web server and a Java server. APIs commonly use JSON to transfer data, like Twilio, which uses services to send SMs to carriers all over the world, but one does not have to see their code implementation. The whole idea behind APIs is that you can just call universal functions, and they will handle everything else.In the case of Twilio, you can just call a function that gets sent to them with a country code, phone number and a message to be sent.hey will handle all the code details about how to get the message sent to a specific country, and take into account all of the carriers that are available. APIs are the statement that models, “Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.”","Agile development, or Scrum, is a form of project management used to develop products.

"The world of the Internet is very wide. In our era you will find a lot of interesting technology that would complete your day-to-day life. This new trend is leveraging the concept of the Internet of Things. These devices that were in the past not connected to the Internet are now available in all retailers. This becomes more and more popular and it all started with the fitness bands. These are bands that let you count all your steps and activity. At first these devices were not very smart or powerful but they were good at doing simple things. Pedometers are the ancestors of fitness bands. The development of these bands is quite impressive. They now have a lot of features and capabilities. People don’t use them to their full potential. The data that is provided by those type of bands can be analysed in such a way that would allow the user to deeply understand their habits. For example, if you see that the step count is very low, you can assume that someone is either sleeping or sedentary. The combination of those steps and other metrics would give you the answer but if we focus on the steps for the moment, you will realise that most of the time people have very similar habits. Their steps could be the same over and over. This is normal and quite expected. Based on that information a model can be created where we can predict what the user will do. For example if a person goes to work every morning at 8:00 a.m. for a long time, the day that the steps count doesn’t go up around that time will allow us to determine that a break in the habit occured. For more information, you can combine the steps with information like the heart rate. Nowadays the devices have those markers quite easily available. The heart rate is even more powerful that the steps. There are only a few moments that can be defined when the heart rate is changing. Either someone is awake and moving around (not exercising), going to the gym, doing exercises, or lying in bed. The last is quite easily identifiable. If you correlate the heart rate with the time of the day, you can assume that the person is sleeping with a good confidence score. The other opportunity that the measurement of the heart rate  allows is to see if someone is under pressure or under stress. By combining the steps with the heart rate, you can have a model that is quite accurate for any sort of activity. For example, if the step count is very low and the heart rate is low, it’s quite obvious that the person is sleeping. If the heart rate is high but step count is low, it’s likely to be gym exercise or treadmill. I’ve never seen a low heart rate and high steps,but I would guess it’s probably an athlete going for a run that doesn’t impact his heart rate. The risk of having those devices collect more data is significant. The manufacturers haven’t used the full potential of the data that is available to them. Instead of analysing and reviewing deeply the information that they have they tend to rush into having more sensors. Those sensors are not always the answer. They can consume battery and therefore not be as good of an option as we think. Unfortunately, manufacturers have to innovate. To me the real innovation is having the ability to make the data talk and to be very good at using the existing technology that allows you to move forward. Being comfortable with the basic technologies is critical for today’s companies. The new and shiny gadgets are not a real demonstration of a company’s innovation. We have had flexible screens for many years but the utilisation as of today is still to be proven. The innovative department of Google called Google X has released nice gadgets from their work but they are not in any way, shape, or form usable by the end users. This is not the future that we should have, and our companies should be more focused on the end user instead of the image that they send. Those parts of the Internet of things are very useful to me. They simply need to be triaged. There are now toothbrushes, umbrellas, and other basic things that we use that are connected. I have difficulty understanding what the purpose of a connected umbrella is. The website advertises that if you forget your umbrella you get a notification. I’m not convinced at all. The same idea with the connected luggages. While it’s good when you lose your luggage to know where it is, I’m not sure how often you will be using that functionality. There is some big filtering to be done in this area and the users are starting to realise that not everything should be connected, as there is no point in doing so. The other trend that is associated with connected devices is the artificial intelligence and machine learning. This to me is the real innovation as long as simple rules are followed. The most important rule for an AI to revolutionize the life or work of someone is that the data it’s collecting is clean. There is an expression in the software industry that says “garbage in, garbage out.” The AI is not a magic tool that would change everything. It will help gradually to understand the amount of data that we have and to make it easily readable for humans. AI doesn’t work on its own. It relies on big data. AI has been around since the ‘50s. One of the first applications of AI was word processing following the scanning of a document. That was a great technology development but nowadays there isn’t a lot of documents that we scan and that we want to turn into text that can be processed. But that task has a specific purpose that the AI was able to tackle.","
The internet is a vast place. In our time, you will discover a lot of interesting technology that will help your daily life, including the newest trend of utilizing the concept of the Internet of Things. These items would not have typically been connected to the internet in the past, but they are now available in all retailers. The trend began with fitness bands, which counted their wearer’s steps and activity. These devices were not particularly complex or powerful at first but were good at carrying out a few simple tasks. Tracing their roots back to early pedometers, fitness bands have developed an impressive amount. These days they each possess many features and capabilities which people rarely fully utilize. They can collect data that can be analyzed to offer users deep insights into their habits. A low step count may indicate a sedentary lifestyle, for example. Plenty of other metrics could offer more nuanced answers, but focusing solely on the step count for the moment, we can see that people usually follow their habits. Step counts can be very similar day after day, for instance. All this is quite normal, expected even, and with that information, a model can be constructed to predict what a user may do. For another example, if a user typically starts their day at a certain time and does not start taking their usual steps one morning, the model can detect that change of routine. Now combine the possibilities of that with data like the user's heart rate. Today’s devices can easily track such data, and information from a user’s heart rate can be even more useful than that of steps. There are only a few times when a user’s heart rate changes, either when they’re awake and doing business, exercising, or lying in bed. That last one is easy to detect with reasonable confidence if you match the heart rate data to the time of day. Heart rate data can also detect periods of high pressure or stress. Combining step and heart rate data makes the model accurate at tracking different kinds of activities. For instance, if the step count and heart rate are both low, it becomes obvious that the user is sleeping. If the heart rate is high, but the step count is low, then the activity is probably some kind of gym exercise. I have never witnessed a low heart rate and high step rate combination, but such a case would probably result from an athlete undergoing mild exercise. There are risks to letting these devices collect more data, although the manufacturers haven’t fully utilized the data available. For now, they seem more intent on adding more sensors to their systems than examining the data they already have. There can be downsides to having more sensors too. For instance, they can consume more battery power than the data they provide ends up being worth. The manufacturers must press on with their superficial changes in the name of innovation. Real innovation lies in communicating data and better utilizing existing technologies. A strong foundation with basic technologies is critical to today’s business world. Shiny new gadgets and gimmicks are not true indicators of innovation. For instance, the technology for flexible screens has existed for many years, yet no practical use for it has been found. Google’s innovation department, “Google X,” has also produced many neat gadgets that are useless to consumers. This is not the future we deserve. These manufacturers need to adjust their priorities away from their projected brand images and toward the needs of their end users. These parts of the Internet of Things have lots of utility and must be managed more effectively. The Internet of Things now includes toothbrushes, umbrellas, and many other basic items, all interconnected. I struggle to find the utility in owning a connected umbrella; their website proclaims that you can be notified if you forget your umbrella. I find this reasoning unconvincing. I feel similarly about connected luggage. It may be useful to find your luggage if it becomes lost, but I do not think that situation is common. The usefulness of the Internet of Things has its limitations, and not everything needs to be connected. Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning are the other growing trend in connected devices. There are opportunities for real innovation here as long as a few basic guidelines are followed. The most important factor in how effective A.I. can be in changing a person’s work or life is the cleanliness of the data it relies upon. This refers to an adage in the software industry, “garbage in, garbage out.” A.I. is not a magic wand that can be waved at any problem, but it will help us gather and understand the data we collect. A.I. is a powerful tool that has been around since the ‘50s, but it cannot do its work without access to a lot of data. One of the first uses for A.I. was as a word processor in document scanning. It was a great technological breakthrough at the time but has considerably fewer applications today when we do not often scan documents. Nonetheless, that was a specific role for which A.I. was well suited.

But I think that would be a lot of work and neither of us has a very large kitchen. It’s a lot cheaper though, so I’m open to starting online and then expanding to a storefront once we have the capital. If we do start online, we’ll have to take delivery into account. It’s not going to be easy without some kind of delivery vehicle, but needing one will depend on the orders we’re filling.

"Your belief system runs your life. If you are unhappy, it is because your beliefs are causing your unhappiness. If you are happy, it is your beliefs that are causing your happiness. These beliefs are the blueprint to your life. Many new-agers today are touting self-development techniques, but they fail to include beliefs. You attend a seminar and you’re all excited and worked-up, but then you go home and all that juice is gone. Why? Because you still have those same beliefs that got you in that unwanted position in the first place. If you really want to change your life, change your beliefs. Well, you might say, “I believe that I should be promoted, but I’m not”. Well, I say you don’t believe that you should be promoted or you would be promoted already. I tell you that your beliefs are right in front of your face, you just have to clear your mind and read your thoughts, and you will change your life. You have taken on so many beliefs throughout your life from many different sources: your parents, your friends, your teachers, the media, etc. All of which are in your subconscious mind. These beliefs are unknown to you because you don’t see outside of yourself most of the time. These beliefs are second nature, and it is difficult for most people to be self-aware if they haven’t done the work. So, I recommend that think about what you want, and ask yourself, “what have I been told about myself and about what I want that would stop me from getting what I want?” Let me give you an example, let’s go back to that promotion. You write down what you want and then you start to think about the people that are in the position you want, but don’t have. You realize they have something special that you don’t, and that maybe they have more vocabulary, or they are more stylish, or they have better teeth, and you couldn’t ever possibly see yourself as good as them. Those would be an example of some beliefs that you hold that stand in the way of your dreams. The way to also identify your beliefs is by tracing your feelings. You want to pay attention to the way you feel when someone says something, or when you have a reaction to something or someone, that gives you an insight into yourself. Feelings are often regarded as a weakness in our society, but they serve a very important purpose in our lives. Feelings can be used as indicators, and when you used properly they can help to transform your life. Allow yourself to feel angry or upset and don’t push your feelings down to avoid processing them because they can tell you a lot about yourself. There is this saying that goes like this: “give me a boy until age seven and I will give you a man.” What do you think they mean when they say this? They are saying that the subconscious mind stays open like a sponge and soaks up information, especially anything said with strong feelings and accepts it as truth. The subconscious mind does not judge, so if you were told you are stupid at a young age, then you subconscious mind believes it. The quote is also saying that the maturity of your life is determined by what information is fed to you until age seven. Many people used to believe that a person can’t change, but we know differently now because the brain is capable of changing itself based on how the mind changes. So if you change your ideas or beliefs in your mind, your brain will change along with it. The reason why so many people get stuck is because they are unaware that they are creating their own lives, they think life is happening to them instead of for them. You are the captain of your ship, and until you start changing your beliefs by going inside and changing what you accepted as true, then nothing will change. You can also know this that we so not revisiti the past to judge, but we use it for interpretation and education. We use it to make connections with how we were in the past, and how that has created our present state today. You must also allow yourself to feel your feelings, because if you are out of touch with yourself to the extent that you don’t know how to feel your feelings then a surefire way to get in touch with yourself is to start asking yourself, “why did I do that”, or “why did I get mad at him like that”? Some beliefs may be more difficult to get rid of than others. That is because some beliefs are more deeply-embedded than others. Basically, it means that there are more layers to support that belief, so it is going to be more challenging and it will take more time to heal that belief than it would for a more superficial belief.  The thoughts in your head that cause you distress are indicators of what you believe, but they aren’t the exact beliefs. Beliefs can only clear as they come up, so the best way is to not waste any time and begin removing those beliefs. There are beliefs that were accepted at different levels of brainwave frequencies and they would be best cleared going back to that brainwave frequency. The four brainwave frequencies are: beta, alpha, theta, and delta. Beta is the awake state, alpha is the daydream state, theta is the drowsy state and delta is the sleep state. The less amount of consciousness you have, the closer you are to the subconscious mind so you can understand your beliefs or clear your beliefs. First, you must understand what they are, and then you can clear them. Many of the beliefs you have, you will find have to do with a lack of deserving this can mean a broad basis of beliefs. Self-love has been said to clear out many beliefs without having to know the exact beliefs. There are many routes to the same destination and a few have been presented here. What is important for you to know is that your beliefs are what run your life, and nothing else. Taking quiet time out everyday is a great way to clear out negative beliefs because it gives your body a break from being in a high state of stress all day long, and it allows your immune system to clear out those thoughts that are causing you so much stress. Food therapy is also another way of helping relieve stress. Just as a man becomes what he thinks, in the same way we are what we eat. There are many ways to heal yourself and your life, just choose one and don’t look back! If your choice hasn’t worked the way you like, you can just choose another method. Just keep going!","Your belief system oversees your life. If you feel happy, it's caused by your beliefs. If you don't feel happy, it's caused by your beliefs. Beliefs are the structural outline of your life. Many current new-agers promote self-development techniques, but they do not include beliefs. You go to a seminar and are stoked and excited, but once you’re home, the feeling is gone. Why? Because you still harness the beliefs that brought you to that unwanted place. If life change is your real goal, you must alter your beliefs. You could say, “I deserve a promotion, but I haven’t gotten one.” I’d say you don’t believe that; otherwise, you’d have the promotion. Your beliefs are right before you; you’ve only got to have a clear head and interpret your thoughts. It’s life-changing. You have adopted so many beliefs from so many sources throughout your life. Sources like parents, friends, teachers, media, and so on. All of this was done subconsciously. You aren’t aware of these beliefs because you can’t perceive them outside of yourself. The beliefs are second nature, and it’s a tall order for people to be self-aware without the proper groundwork. You should think about what you want and then ask yourself, “What have I been told about myself and what I want that would stop me from getting what I want?” Here’s an example. Let’s talk about the promotion again. You jot down your desires and begin thinking about people with what you want. You recognize that they’ve got something special that you don’t have. Maybe they even know more words, dress better, have nicer teeth, and you couldn’t ever see yourself as their equal. This is an example of beliefs you hold that become obstacles to achieving your dreams. You can also identify your beliefs by tracing your feelings. You should note how you feel when someone says something or when you’re reacting to something or someone; that helps you to learn about yourself. Society often considers feelings a form of weakness, but they are important in our lives. Feelings can be signifiers; when used properly, they can help you change your life. Allow yourself to process your anger or how you’re upset. Don’t shove your feelings down to avoid them because they tell you a lot about yourself. A motto goes like this, “give me a boy until he’s seven years old, and I will give you a man.” What do you think this means? They’re saying that the subconscious mind absorbs information. It accepts things said with strong feelings as truth. The subconscious mind doesn’t make inferences about anything, so if someone told you you were dumb when you were little, your subconscious mind accepted it as truth. The quote also means that your maturity is determined by what information you absorb until you are seven. Many people used to think that a person can’t change, but we know that isn’t true because the brain can change itself based on how the mind changes. So, if you adjust the ideas or beliefs in your mind, your brain will adjust accordingly. So many people can’t progress because they don’t know they’re creating their own lives. They think that life is happening to them instead of happening to them. You’re the captain of your vessel, and unless you start changing your beliefs by adjusting what your insides have accepted as truth, nothing will be different. We can’t revisit the past to make new judgments but use it to learn and adjust our perceptions. We can use it to connect to who we used to be and how that journey has brought us to our present selves. You have to let yourself feel what you’re feeling. If you’re out of sync with yourself, then a foolproof method of returning to yourself is to ask, “Why did I do that?” or “Why did I get so upset with him?” Some beliefs are harder to dispose of than others. That’s because some beliefs are deeper in us than others. It means there are more layers to support that belief, so it will be harder and will take longer to recover than it would be for a more exterior belief. Things that make you feel stressed are markers of what you believe, but they aren’t exact. Beliefs can only become clear as they’re encountered, so the best thing to do is not to waste a second and dispose of those beliefs. Some beliefs were accepted at different brainwave frequencies and are best eliminated by returning to that frequency. The four frequencies are beta, alpha, theta, and delta. Beta is the awake state, alpha is the daydream state, theta is the exhausted state, and delta is the sleep state. The less conscious you are, the closer you are to your subconscious mind, and you’ll better understand your beliefs and get rid of them. Many of your beliefs concern a sense of undeserving, which can mean various things. Self-love is thought to get rid of a lot of beliefs without knowing what they are. There are a lot of paths to the same place, and some are mentioned here. You must know that your life is centered on your beliefs, and that’s it. Have a silent period each day. It’s a great method for clearing negative beliefs because it relieves stress and lets your immune system clear out stress-inducing thoughts. You can also relieve stress through food therapy. Just like a man becomes what he thinks, he also becomes what he eats. There are many avenues to hear yourself and life. Choose one and keep pushing.

"Employees typically fall into two categories, sellers and merch. Sellers are constantly on the floor approaching customer and asking them what they need. They float around looking for “targets.” It sounds harsh, but they have to make a certain amount of money per hour. They typically get the most dressed up and have a huge client base. They are never still. They are always running around, trying to find new clients, and they are good at what they do. It is amazing to see them in action. On the other side of the equation is “merch,” short for merchandise. These are the people who directly handle the merchandise. They restock shelves, fix bra displays, and also sell merchandise to customers. They do a bit of everything in the store. Working with merchandise can get overwhelming, because you are expected to do so much, while still making sure that your table is in order. It really is the best job for multi-taskers.

"As an expert in customer service, I have to say that giving the right attitude to customers all the time isn’t easy. But if you just keep wearing that smile and giving them that happy attitude they deserve, then it’ll get a lot easier for you. Whenever I was feeling at the end of my energy, and I really didn’t want to talk to anyone, or I was just simply in a bad mood, I just kept giving customers a smile and respect, and it made me feel better about it all. For me, making somebody feel better makes me feel better. I don’t know if that’s the case for you, but when I followed this mantra of just showing love and giving support to customers, the higher-ups saw me going above and beyond for the company, and they were impressed! They wanted to promote me and make me the face of the company whenever customers came in. I worked at a Wendy’s, and I had only been working there for about three months or so, and they were already going to promote me to crew trainer because I was so good with people. They figured I could train anybody, and I sure did. They always had me working the register so that I could talk to the customers, because if they were having a bad day and being short with the one taking their order, they’d always see me and change that attitude real quickly! They would be so happy to see me, all because I gave them respect and a smile on my face. It made working the job so much easier, not seeing the same lifeless faces come through the drive-thru everyday, but seeing smiles instead, and getting, “Hey! How you been?!” instead of just them handing me my money in silence. If you just give the customer something to work with, they’ll take that positive energy and shoot it right back at you. Of course you have some sticklers and the people who just gave up on human interactions, but you’ve got to lose some to win some, you know? To have this mindset isn’t so hard. You should just think about it from their point of view! Would you rather have somebody whojust doesn’t care at all, with a dead look in their eyes and nothing to say, or what I was talking about: a worker with purpose and something to say everytime you come up to the window, somebody that will engage when you haven’t had much engagement in the day? I’d rather have the second option. Of course, as I said, there are going to be some people who prefer the first option, but hopefully they’ll come around eventually. I remember there was a guy—I promise you his name was Jim Bob. He was always so grumpy—not like meh grumpy, but loud grumpy; let everybody around him know that he’s grumpy kind of grumpy. So one day I asked him, “Hey Jim, how was your day? Anything new happen?” and he said to me that he just got back from the hospital because his mother’s heart was failing, and she’d been dealing with this for a while now. I gave words of encouragement and comfort and a free drink to say, “Hope your day gets better!”. He came in the next day as happy as can be. This man had been grumpy all his life, but he came in with a smile on his face, asking me the same question I asked him the day before. He said his mother was doing better, that the talk we had yesterday really helped him out, and he’s been coming into Wendy’s really happy to see me ever since. It feels good because he was one of worst customers before. We dreaded seeing him come in, but now he’s a good ol’ regular. I only have a couple more stories like that, and they’re from other places where I’ve worked, and honestly, you probably don’t want to hear about them. They’re a little longer than that last one. But nonetheless, it’s a great way of making yourself and others feel happy, and I can’t stress enough how important it is for a business when you give their customers some really good customer service. They’ll always want to come back so that they can be treated nicely, and it gives you a little confidence boost. There’s a saying at one of my older jobs that, “you should leave your troubles at the door when you come into work.” I like that saying a lot because I’m so good at customer service because of it. It made me a better person; made me the man I am today because of that silly saying. I regret working at the job, but I don’t regret what I’ve learned from it. You know what? Have fun with it as well. Try to make some friends, why don’t you? Don’t try to give them your number or be too pushy, but whenever they come to visit, it should feel good to you; give you a little pep boost in the middle of the day. Going to work and seeing somebody you know there just makes it easier, don’t you think? I really do strongly feel that way. Whenever I’m working with my friends, I feel as if the day just goes by a lot faster. But all in all, customer service is more than just chores, an extra standard you have to tack onto the list of standards you already have for the company. It’s a way of life. You become a better speaker outside of work, and you get to talk to some people you may have thought were pretty interesting. Plus you make some new friends, which is always a nice bonus. But don’t forget, it also helps you out with the higher-ups! Getting promotions and good things like that is easy if you show you care about the company.","As someone well-versed in customer service, I have to admit that showing a good attitude to customers all the time isn’t easy. It'll be a lot easier for you to put on a gleeful smile and show them the good attitude they ought to have. Whenever I was tired and just wanted to keep to myself or was in a bad mood, I kept showing customers smiles and respect, which made me feel better. Putting someone else in a good mood puts me in a good mood. I don’t know how it works for you, but when I abide by this code of simply loving and supporting customers, the bosses saw me going the extra mile for the company and were impressed! They were interested in promoting me and making me the first face customers saw as they walked in. I’d only worked at Wendy’s for three months, give or take, and they wanted to promote me to crew trainer because I’m so friendly. They thought they could train anybody and thought right they did. They ensured I worked the register so I could talk to customers because if someone were in a bad mood and snippy with the person taking their order, they’d see me and shape their attitude quickly! They were so happy to see me because I was respectful and smiling. It made the job easier, not seeing the same dull faces day in and day out, but getting smiles from people instead and getting, “Hey! What’s been up!?” Rather than someone quietly giving me their money. If you show the customer some positive energy, something they can work with, they’ll return that energy to you. Of course, some folks are nitpicky or just give up on being friendly with other people, but you can’t win some games without losing some games. Am I right? It isn’t tough to think like me. You just have to put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Would you want someone who doesn’t care the slightest, with dead eyes and zipped lips, or what I mentioned before: an employee with intent and something to offer every time you come to the window, someone who’ll interact with you if you haven’t had much interaction that day? I’d take the second option. As I said, some want the first option, but I hope they’ll have a change of heart one day. There was this guy. I swear his name was Jim Bob. He always had a bad attitude and didn’t keep it to himself. One day I asked him, “Hey, Jim. How’s your day going?” Anything new?” He said he had just got back from the hospital, his mom’s heart was failing, and she’d been having trouble with it for a while. I told him some uplifting and comforting things and gave him a free drink to say, “I hope your day goes up from here!” He walked in the next day as happy as I’d ever seen him. This man had spent his entire life grumpy, but he walked in with a smile and asked me the same question I’d asked him the day before. He said his mom was feeling better, and he felt helped by the talk we had, and he’s been happy every time he’s come into Wendy’s since. I feel good about this because he used to be one of our worst customers. We loathed seeing him come in, but now he’s one of the regulars. I’ve only got one or two more stories similar to that one, and they’re from other jobs I’ve had, and to be frank, I doubt you want to hear them. They’re a bit longer than the one I just told you about. Either way, it’s a superb way to make yourself and those around you happy, and I can’t highlight enough how important it is for a company when its customers get good service. They’ll always want to come back and get treated well, giving you a rush of esteem. A motto from one of my old jobs is, “you should leave your troubles at the door when you come to work.” I like that saying a bunch because it makes me really good at customer service. That silly phrase made me a better person and a better man. I regret working at that job, but not what I learned from it. You know? Have fun with the work also. Try to make a buddy or two. Don’t push it on anyone or give them your number, but whenever they visit, it should feel warm; it gives you a little boost in the middle of the shift. Things are easier when you’re going to work and get to see someone you know there. What do you think? I think that’s the case. The day also seems to get along faster when working with friends. Overall, customer service is more than just a duty, an extra protocol in a pile of protocols. It’s a way of being. You become more eloquent outside of work and meet nice people you have found intriguing. And it’s always a bonus making new friends. Don’t forget; it also helps with the bosses! Getting promotions and nice things like that are easy when you show that you care about the business.",Paraphrase this text,paraphrase

"I will be discussing the proper way to make Starbucks beverages. Many of the drinks can be prepared very quickly by dispensing them from insulated containers, such as the coffee and  hot water thermals, and the iced coffee and tea dispensers. For many Starbucks customers, their interest tends to venture into more difficult-to-craft drinks. In order to make a latte, you must first steam the milk. This is done by pouring the customer’s choice of milk into a silver, canister-like device, then inserting a heated rod that will blow steam into the milk. Be sure to insert only the tip at first, allowing it to heat only the surface, and then lift the rod out a moment before plunging it all the way in. This will prevent a, frankly, disturbing and loud noise that the machine will make if the rod is inserted directly into cold milk, so it is encouraged that we do it this way to prevent disturbing our customers and ourselves. The thing to do once the milk is settled in and steaming, is to put in the customer’s choice of syrup. A latte does not, by default, come with syrup, and syrup often costs extra, but many people still sweeten them. The correct, default amount of syrup for the sizes are as follows: two pumps in a tall, four pumps in a grande, and five pumps in a venti. If the venti is iced, an additional pump should be added for a total of six, as the iced venti cups are a little bit bigger than the hot cups. Then, it is time to draw the espresso shots from the espresso machine. This is done simply with the click of a button. Talls get one shot. Grandes and ventis get two shots, and iced ventis get three. It is crucial not to let the espresso sit without introducing the milk for any more than ten seconds, as prolonged exposure to the air will sour it and give it a distinctly unpleasant taste. Pour the steamed milk into it slowly, encouraging the non-foamy milk to enter it first, and the foam to rest on top. Some people encourage less-practiced employees to use a spoon in order to hold back the foam initially, then release it at the end. If you steam the milk just right, you will be able to make latte art in it by pouring it in a distinct way. That is how to make a latte. A macchiato is prepared by pouring the shots on top at the end, after the milk and syrup are in the cup. A cappuccino is made by making the milk more steamy by keeping the rod near the top for longer. It contains more foam.","I will be talking about how to create Starbucks beverages properly. Several beverages can be made rapidly from insulated containers like coffee, hot water thermals, and iced coffee and tea dispensers. Many Starbucks customers have the propensity to be interested in drinks that are more challenging to make. When preparing a latte, you must steam the milk first. To do this, the customer’s choice of milk is poured into a silver, canister-like device, and a heated rod is inserted to blow steam into the milk. Make sure to insert the tip initially, which will only heat the surface, and then lift the rod out for a second before inserting it completely. We should do it this way to avoid creating an extremely loud and irritating noise that the machine makes, which may disturb our customers and us if the rod is put directly into cold milk. Once the milk has settled in and steamed, the customer's preferred syrup should be added. Although lattes do not come with syrup and are often an additional expense, many people add sugar to them. Two pumps in a tall, four in a grande, and five in a venti are the standard syrup for each size. An extra pump should be added for six if the venti is iced because the iced venti cups are a tiny bit larger than the hot cups. The espresso shots should then be drawn from the espresso maker. A simple button click accomplishes this. So, give one shot for talls, two for grandes and ventis, and three for iced ventis. It is important that espresso not be left for more than 10 seconds without adding the milk, as doing so will cause a long exposure to air, which will sour it and impart a decidedly disagreeable flavor. Add the steamed milk to it gradually, letting the non-foamy milk go first and allowing the foam to rest on top. Some individuals advise inexperienced workers to use a spoon to hold the foam back before releasing it at the end. If you steam the milk properly, you may create latte art by carefully pouring it distinctly. That is how a latte is made. After the milk and syrup are in the cup, a macchiato is made by finally adding the shots on top. A cappuccino is created by making the milk steamier by keeping the rod towards the top longer. It has more foam in it.",Paraphrase this text,paraphrase
"For example, the designer might want to lay out a desktop design that has text in three columns across the page. The designer will use Bootstrap classes to lay out the text in three page columns by making each text element the width of four grid columns. Those same three columns can then be condensed to two columns next to each other and one stacked below on a smaller-sized screen such as a tablet, also by using Bootstrap classes. To take it one step further, each of the three text elements can stretch across an entire screen, stacked in one long column, with more help from Bootstrap.","For example, the designer may prefer to insert a desktop design that has text in three columns across the page.

"DNA quantification is set up on the liquid handling robot and read on a fluorometer.  First make sure you have appropriate standards for the assay. These should be aliquoted out and placed in the fridge. We use the 0-100ng standards to ensure all sample concentration ranges are covered. Take out the standards and shake them on a plate shaker while allowing to come to room temperature. Whilst the standards are shaking, prepare the assay buffer. This is made up in a 1:200 ratio of dye to buffer. Add an extra couple of samples to your calculation for pipetting error. Make up this working buffer solution in a reservoir container.  Next get your samples that you want to quantify ready. Make sure they are shaken on the plate shaker or vortexed. Quickly spin down using a centrifuge for thirty seconds. Once all the reagents and samples are ready, you can set up the robot. Once the software has loaded, you must initialise the system. This is found under the menu ‘instrument’ and then ‘home all axis’. The programs will not run without initialising the robot first. If this is not done an error message will come up when you press ‘start’. Once initialised, select the ‘run’ button from the top toolbar. This will bring up a prompt for you to enter how many columns you are doing. Input the number. Next it will ask you to scan in the barcode of the sample plate and quant plate. This information is needed for quality tracking and will be stored in the LIMS system. Next the software will bring up a prompt showing where to place the consumables on the deck.

"For this document, I am going to explain how to complete all of the daily tasks for my job as a digital producer for a publishing-related magazine and website. These instructions should allow someone to fill in for me, and do my job when I am out of the office. Twice weekly, it is my job to compile and publish a newsletter that is then sent to around 30,000 opt-in subscribers. “Opt in” means that all of our subscribers manually signed up for the newsletter through our website, and they are not being sent any content they didn’t subscribe to. One of the first things I do when I come in is to look through my email and Dropbox and see who has sent me articles and images. Each week, the newsletter contains some custom or new content, as well as content from the website and digitized versions of the print articles. Often the print articles need to be digitized by me. This is usually the easiest task to accomplish because the articles are already proofed and have already been published. So I don’t need to wait for anyone to respond to me or to get me assets. Each week, you can access the newsletter outline in our shared drive on the company network. It will tell you what articles are going into the newsletter, as well as which authors are being featured in the section which highlights book deals from that week. It also contains some information about the advertisements and various articles which will be linked on the side of the newsletter but not featured. These are typically older articles that were popular, or some recurring features like reviews of the week, and the bestseller lists. After you have gone through your email and Dropbox, and you have downloaded any content that you received from the editors, you should save all of the assets in individual folders inside the newsletter folder on the shared drive. It is important to never modify the original file in case we need it in the future. To that end, I find it is best to create a subfolder in each article folder called “originals”. This is where I store all the original files. Once articles have been approved, you can begin adding them to the newsletter template in the CMS. There are links to the CMS pages on your desktop. Once you get into the CMS you can create a new article by pushing the New Article button. Each article needs to have four headlines. The headlines are for web, print, newsletter, and subscription. They are usually all the same headline, but the article won’t publish correctly without all four filled in. It is also important to choose a category for the article. Since the newsletter is children’s-themed, you always want to choose the options under “children’s”. If it is an interview or profile, you should choose the option “Author”. If it is related to bookselling news you should choose that category. Bookselling news is anything like a trade fair, book fair, author convention, events and so forth. This category also includes anything that is related to a book deal. So this will include the book deals article. The “Books” category is pretty self-explanatory, this refers to any article of book round-ups, reviews, and the like. It’s usually pretty easy to tell if something is book news or author news, but if you feel confused you can ask someone. We also have the category “Common Core”. This comes up pretty rarely but is, as the name suggests, about the Common Core. After you choose the category, you can copy and paste the article into the article content box. Often, formatting doesn’t carry over properly so it is important to check and make sure all the italics and things copy over. It is also important to check any hyperlinks that might be in the story. Next, you need to create a blurb for the story. This is usually the first few sentences of the article, but sometimes if the article is less ‘newsy’ it is just a summary of the articles contents. For instance, you don’t want to lead off a profile with a quote as the blurb, even though a quote is often the first thing in the blurb. When formatting interviews, it is important to put the questions that the interviewer asks in bold/blue and the intro above the interview in italics. After that, you can save the article and hit “Preview.” Make sure everything looks good then go back into the article page on the CMS and add any photos. To add photos, scroll down and click “Add Media”. The photos shouldn’t be any wider than 600 pixels. The photo in the first position is always the photo that shows up on the preview. To actually make the images appear in the article, you add the tag [photo NAMEOFPHOTO width=”600”]. You can make the width smaller if you don’t want it to stretch the entire width of the article page. You can also add captions below the image. Again check the preview link. If it looks good, you can then go to the newsletter CMS page and add the article. You should also add a small preview image. We crop preview images in a 5x4 ratio for consistency. Once all of the articles have been proofread and added, and once they are in the template, you should check the newsletter preview. Make sure the blurbs make sense and that they haven’t been cut off. Make sure the images are clear and not pixelated, and that they are consistently sized. It is also crucial to make sure that none of the advertisements conflict with the stories. The marketing team will add the ads in (but make sure they work) yet it is important that we aren’t running an article about a new book that is being advertised in the issue. It looks like a conflict of interest. If there is an ad for something we have an article about, we can always just hold the article until next week. Once you have everything proofed, send the link to the children’s editor and she will check it out. If there any changes are  needed, she will let you know. Once any final changes have been made, you can send the CMS link to the digital team and they will send it out. Always try to send out the newsletter by 5:00 PM EST.","

"For these types of NPRs, you want to use the reason code unable to reroute. This would be one of the few NPRs that it isn’t necessary to forward to delivery research for review. There are also two different types of exchanges: prepaid exchange and advanced exchange. A prepaid exchange would be if the customer needed a different size or a different color. A prepaid exchange would be processed if the exchange is  not our fault. The customer would be charged upfront for the exchange and would be refunded once the original item was returned and processed. An advanced exchange shouldn’t be used very often. This type of exchange would be used if there was a service error on our part. For example, if we sent the wrong item, the wrong color, or if they received a defective product, we would process the exchange as an advanced exchange. These are processed on our courtesy account. This means that the customer isn’t charged upfront. However, they must return the wrong or defective item within thirty days. If the item isn’t returned within thirty days, the credit card on file will be charged for the item that was not returned. It is very important to let the customer know that the item must be returned to our warehouse by mail within thirty days. If returned in a store, the charge will still generate, as we don’t use the same system for mail orders as we do for the store. If this happens, please contact CCL for resolution. It is also a good idea to tell the customer to keep a copy of the tracking number for the return in case  the returned package gets lost or stolen. For packages that are lost or stolen, we will send out a replacement at no charge, as long as the customer doesn’t have another NPR for a stolen package within the last six months. We don’t have a time limit on returns. Returns are always free. Most packages will arrive with a prepaid return label and form. However, to save on costs, packages shipping from a full-time store may not have a prepaid return label and form included. If the customer needs a label, they can go to Nordstrom’s website and type returns in the search box. They will be able to print out as many prepaid return labels and forms as they need here. Returns are processed within ten to fourteen business days. Refunds are automatically issued to the original form of payment on file. If a gift card or Nordstrom note was used, a refund will be issued in the form of a gift card. Gift cards will be shipped to the original shipping address and arrive within three to six business days. Gift recipients are also able to return items by mail and in store, or they can also print out a return label and form from our website. It is very important that they fill out the gift recipient section on the form to ensure that the exchange or refund is shipped to them and not the gift giver. They may also take their return to the store as well. The sales associate may try to locate the original purchase. They may be able to do so with the name and zip code or phone number of the gift giver. If they are unable to locate the order this way, the gift recipient will be refunded the last sale price of the item. For example, if the item is now on sale for 50% less, they will be refunded that amount without proof of purchase. Nordstrom offers in store gift wrapping to customers as a courtesy. Sadly, the gift wrapping service for online orders costs two dollars per order. We understand that this may upset some customers. However, our warehouses aren’t as easily equipped with these supplies or manpower. Customers can also take items that they purchased online to their local Nordstrom for free gift wrapping. Nordstrom offers a wonderful rewards program for our loyal customers. It is called Nordstrom Rewards. Customers can earn two points per dollar spent when using a Nordstrom brand payment method. This can be the Nordstrom Visa, debit card, or retail card. This doesn’t include a gift card. If a customer would like to use their own credit or debit card, they earn one point per dollar. For every 2,000 points earned, they will receive a twenty dollar note in the mail or via email. These notes can be used online and in stores — at Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, or HauteLook. These expire after one year and cannot be reissued if they expire before the customer uses the note. If you receive any calls from customers regarding their credit account, we don’t have access to that information. In such cases, please transfer them to Nordstrom Credit. They are also available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

The gift recipient will receive the item's last sale price if the associates cannot find the order. For example, if the item is now on sale for 50% off, they will be refunded that amount without a receipt. As a courtesy, Nordstrom offers in-store gift-wrapping services to customers. Regrettably, the fee for the gift-wrapping service for online sales is $2 per order. We acknowledge that this may annoy some customers. However, our warehouses are not as efficiently prepared with the required supplies or manpower. Also, customers can bring their online purchases to their neighborhood Nordstrom for gift wrapping. Nordstrom has a great rewards program, Nordstrom Rewards, for our loyal customers. Customers can earn two points per dollar spent using a Nordstrom brand payment method: a Nordstrom Visa, debit card, or retail card. This does not include a gift card. Customers make one point per dollar using their credit or debit card. They will get a $20 bill in the mail or via email for every 2,000 points earned. These notes can be utilized online and in stores like Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, or HauteLook. They have a one-year expiration date and cannot be renewed if the consumer fails to use the note. We do not have access to customers' credit account information, so if you get any calls from customers with respect to their credit accounts, transfer them to Nordstrom Credit.

"Viscometers allow the measurement of the viscosity of a solution. There are various types of viscometers used in laboratories, but one of the most simple is the Ostwald viscometer. The principle of a viscometer is as follows: the time taken for a sample to flow down a narrow capillary between two marker lines is measured. This time is compared to the time taken for water to flow between the same lines. By dividing these two times, relative viscosity can be determined. A viscometer must use a narrow capillary to ensure that the viscous properties of the fluid are influential on the flow time. A wide capillary would mean that the inertial forces are larger than the viscous forces, making the flow turbulent. More complex viscometers use multiple capillaries and allow for the determination of kinematic viscosity. Viscometers are incredibly important to the chemical industry, in particular with fuels. A fuel’s viscosity must be known precisely at a wide range of temperatures, so that it can be transported and used safely. A large change in viscosity with temperature could lead to unexpected behaviour, for example, in an engine, which could be dangerous.","Viscometers can measure the viscosity of a solution. There are multiple kinds of viscometers employed in laboratories, and a fundamental one is the Ostwald viscometer.

"This essay is about the profound relationship of male sexuality to female sexuality and its socially individual variables, which have to be considered in terms of any social interaction. You as my potential customer will receive a quick and informative overview over the gender dynamics of male and female beings, so you’re going to be able to consider the most important factors of this dynamic within the context of your future social interactions with the opposite gender. Starting out with the harsh reality of both genders not being aware of each other’s desires , today’s men and women are facing a serious problem of ineffective intergender communication. This lack of quality communication between the sexes leads to a broad variety of societal challenges when it comes to successful attraction and retainment of a desired mate for copulation, as well as the continued nurturingof family bonds. Societal and scientific institutions haven’t been able to figure out the underlying dynamics of intergender behavior and communication, and they are additionally struggling to communicate the discoveries that have been made so far to the public. Generally speaking, intergender behavior (better known as dating/mating dynamics) are based on profound evolutionary principles going back millions of years to our very early ancestors. One example of those underlying principles is women’s desire for a “real man” or “alpha male”, who can be recognized through certain intrinsic characteristics, as well as specific external achievements and accomplishments. In public, common belief states that most women desire a rich, good-looking man for the sole purpose of accessing his materialistic gains. This may be partly true, since material abundance usually leads to a more secure, more comfortable existence through abundance of time, choices and higher quality resources. Contrary to this belief are examples of men, who indeed are in ownership of the same intrinsic characteristics like self-discipline, emotional self-control, work ethic, industriousness, etc., but who do not have accomplished or acquired a similar financial or materialistic status yet. These men are still desired by the majority of women despite their lack (or willfully chosen absence) of financial and materialistic success. These exceptions do highlight the theory of women being attracted to so-called alpha males, even if they don’t display the full range of characteristics internally as well as externally. Only a subset of alpha traits seems to be sufficient for the successful attraction of a mate for future copulation. A reason for this might be either expected external success in the future due to existing intrinsic characteristics, or the sheer presence of intrinsic characteristics as being good enough to make the female feel secure and protected enough to engage in copulation. In both cases, this result would serve as evidence against the popular belief that only good-looking, successful, and rich males receive all the attraction from the female population. This would also indicate that men not being part of a rich and successful family, nor being genetically gifted with good looks right after birth would be able to increase the attraction received by females through learning and adapting to the mentioned alpha characteristics. Conscious display of these characteristics would then eventually lead to more successful interactions with female mating partners, as well as more efficient intergender communication through understanding these attraction principles with the opposite gender. Without understanding these principles, both genders (but primarily men) increasingly face a more challenging world in terms of accomplishing sexual interactions, dating frequency and quality as well as long-term family bonds. After having studied and experimented with these principles for years, you as my potential customer will be guaranteed the proper access (and therefore understanding) of the most important and vital mating principles. The correct understanding of these will help you to dramatically increase your personal future prospects in the short- and long-term mating and dating market. No matter if male or female – the correct interpretation of the behavioural nuances of the opposite sex is vital to access an actionable system for the improvement of your own personal behavioural aspects and subtleties. Not only will you learn how to adapt an attractive appearance through proper style, clothing and expression in terms of body language, articulation, and expression. In addition, very complex concepts like internal belief systems, conscious choice of self-talk and the reading of other people’s psychology will be taught in a quickly adaptable way for you to implement right on the spot. Therefore, immediate short-term as well as long-term success with the opposite sex and in terms of intergender communication and interaction can be guaranteed by me personally. Also beneficial for other aspects of your private as well as professional life, this broad set of skills is an essential part on the journey to becoming a sophisticated person, including all internal, positive changes as well as external accomplishments like money, high social status, and materiali abundance of choice in quality and quantity terms. Only through the correct interpretation of existing laws and principles will you be able to achieve the life of your dreams. Only through acquiring the essential knowledge  will you be able to improve yourself, but also your current circumstances if you have the desire to do so. Beyond the common belief of proper education within the academic system, I personally believe in lifelong learning. This is a unique opportunity to gain vital knowledge about the real underlying principles of intergender dynamics and all its subtlte nuances, whose neglect can lead to detrimental consequences. In conclusion, learning about the most successful communication and mating strategies of both males and females will help you to improve the areas of your life you wish to increase in quality and also in quantity if necessary. These changes cannot be made through common sense alone, nor through the implementation of knowledge taught within the realm of the academic system of schools, universities and other public institutions. These sources of knowledge have proven their lack of efficiency within their ability of fully discovering all existent principles and are in conclusion not suited as capable of successfully teaching them yet either.","This article is regarding the intense connection of male sexual instincts to female sexual instincts and its varying individual aspects, which must be considered regarding any social communication. As my possible consumer, you will get a fast and instructional outline of the gender contrasts between male and female individuals. You will be able to think of the most pertinent aspects of this contrast within the inevitable situations of your eventual social communications with the other gender. Initializing with the hard truth of either gender not understanding what one another wants. Modern men and women have a momentous issue of unproductive intergender conversation. This lack of sincere conversation between the sexes motivates various social hardships regarding the ability to attract and attain a desired mate for intercourse and sustain familial connections. Social and scientific schools have not figured out the subtextual contrasts between intergender conduct and conversation. They are also finding it hard to speak on the new findings that have been made so far to the people in general. Intergender conduct (better recognized as dating/mating contrasts) is generally rooted in amazing evolutionary rudiments tracing back millions of years to our extremely early ancestors. One piece of evidence of those subtextual rudiments is women’s want for a “real man” or “alpha male,” which can be found through specific inherent character aspects and specific exterior feats and successes. Within the social standard, the common thought is that most women want an affluent, handsome man to get to his money and assets. This can be somewhat correct since affluence usually comes with a sturdy and easy life most of the time in terms of choices and the quality of resources. The opposite of this understanding are examples of males, who indeed have ownership of these inherent aspects such as self-discipline, internal self-control, work ethic, industriousness, etc., but have not succeeded or gained similar money or asset-related status yet. These males are still wanted by most women disregarding their lack (or chosen absence) of money and assets. These deviations notice the idea of women being attracted to what’s known as alpha males, even if they do not show the entire scope of aspects emotionally and in action. Only a portion of alpha aspects looks to be enough for the attraction of a mate for eventual intercourse. A reason for this could be anticipated action-related success eventually because of existing inherent aspects or the existence of inherent aspects as being enough to make the woman feel sturdy and guarded enough to have intercourse. In either case, this answer would be evidence refuting the popular thought that only handsome, successful, and wealthy men get all the attention from women. This would also be proof that men not being in a wealthy and successful family, nor being naturally gifted with handsomeness right after being born, would have the ability to heighten the attention received by women through learning and adapting to the explained alpha aspects. Intentional showing of these aspects would then lead to more fruitful communications with possible female intercourse partners, along with more effective intergender conversation through learning these attraction rudiments with the opposite gender. Without learning these rudiments, both sexes (but mostly men) continually find a harder world in achieving sexual intercourse, dating abundance, standards, and long-term family connections. Having analyzed and tested these rudiments for years, as my possible consumer, you will be one hundred percent given the correct access (and so understanding) to the most pertinent and important mating rudiments. The right understanding of these will assist you in seriously heightening your eventual personal goals in the short-term and long-term intercourse and dating scene. It doesn’t matter if you’re male or female – the right way to think of the behavioral intricacies of the other sex is very important to find an actionable procedure for the betterment of your own personal behavioral aspects and subtleties. Not only will you learn how to find an alluring look through the right style, garments, and demeanor in the sense of body language, diction, and demeanor. Also, extremely complicated ideas like inner-belief systems, deliberate choice of self-talk, and the interpreting of other individuals’ psychology will be educated on in a swiftly adjustable way for you to implement immediately. So, instant short-term and long-term achievement with the opposite sex and in the sense of intergender conversation and communication can be assured me personally. Also helpful for other parts of your personal as well as professional lifestyle, this wide range of skills is a needed portion on the trek to growing into an experienced person, counting all inner, good alterations and physical achievements like finances, high social reputation, and resource bounty of choice in quality and amount terms. Only through the right understanding of current laws and rudiments will you be able to achieve the life you have always hoped for. Only through getting the needed understanding will you have the ability to better yourself, but also your present happenings if you want to. Further than the usual belief of serious education within the academic system, I trust that you are learning your entire life. This is a special opportunity to gain a pertinent understanding of the real subtextual rudiments of intergender connections and all its elusive differences, whose neglect can motivate serious consequences. Finally, educating yourself about the most fruitful conversation and intercourse game plans of both men and women will assist you in improving the places of your life you wish to heighten in standard and amount if needed. These alterations cannot be made through common judgment by yourself nor through the execution of understanding educated within the realm of the academic system of schools, colleges, and more public institutions. These sources of understanding have given evidence to their lack of production within their capability of discovering all rudiments and are finally not suited to successfully educating them yet.",Rewrite this text,paraphrase

Warm lights are yellowish red in tint, and cool lights are white or blue colors. They are rated in degrees Kelvin.  The lower the degree K the warmer the light.  Mixing cool and warm lights might provide some cinematic flavor to a shot or scene, but it should be avoided in an educational setting, as it will provide a distraction to students.  As for fluorescent lights, make sure your camera settings do not produce “flicker” when filming them. If this occurs, try adjusting the FPS and the exposure settings.  Make sure you test these settings before you go live!  Another thing to watch out for is lines moving down the screen, this is caused by lights putting out light in a frequency that conflicts with the camera settings.

"Today I am going to be talking about how to effectively manage a call center. It is a topic I am very familiar with, and I have a lot of information to share. The first thing that any person looking to manage a call center will need is a lot of patience. Between staff issues, technical problems and customer complaints, there are many points of running a call center that can be stressful. As a manager, you need to be able to keep calm under pressure and also help others cope with any pressures. Staff members will look to you for reassurance and guidance, so you need to always be prepared to help. You also need to have some prior knowledge regarding the equipment you are using, because if something goes wrong, you will need to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Every minute the phones aren’t answered is costing the company money, and possibly causing a customer complaint. You will also need to be an understanding and empathetic person as your staff members will often come to you for help and advice, and you need to be able to help them effectively. As a manager, you will also be required to handle escalated customer complaints and defuse possible tensions. This is where the patience and empathy will come in handy. Customers can often be demanding and impatien. You, as the manager, will need to make the time to listen to their issue and offer an appropriate solution. You will also need to have the ability to not take things personally. Sometimes, customers will vent their frustrations on the first person they see or speak to. As the first point of call for the company, you need to be able to conduct yourself in a professional manner to staff and customers. You need to be able to leave your problems and stresses at home and go to work with a positive attitude. Customers will be able to tell if you are not in a good mood, and they will not appreciate it if you take your feelings out on them. One of the most crucial points is attention to detail. Regardless of the type of company you work for, or what you are selling or offering, attention to detail is imperative. Mistakes cost the company money and that’s not good. Let’s be real, mistakes do happen. Nobody is perfect, but you when you make a mistake, you need to notice it promptly and address the issue. Any issues that may seem small to you may be a big issue to the company or to the customer, so pay close attention. I would advise double-checking all work completed just to avoid any mistakes, even if it takes longer the first time. You are saving time by not having to go back and correct any mistakes. The customer and the company will thank you for your attention to detail. If you are looking to become a call center manager, you will need to be passionate about what you are offering as a business, whether it be stationery or apples. Passion is fundamental. Your passion will reflect in everything you do, and it will rub off on others around you. Having passion in your job is the key to happiness. Not every day will be a great day, but as long as you try, that’s all anyone can do. Solving customer issues can also be rewarding. Customers will go out of their way to thank you for helping them and so will your team! Many people think working in a call center is just picking up a phone, but it is so much more than that. You are the face of the company. You are the person the customer interacts with. You are the person selling the products. Without you, there would be no “us”. I have worked as a call center manager for many years now, and I find it a rewarding role. It’s not without its challenges, but that’s what makes every day different and interesting. You will need to change things up to keep things fresh, otherwise you will lose interest and passion — and by that point maybe even your job. Switch things up by answering with a different greeting, changing around your script (if you use one). Offer different products that you might not have offered before. Just do something different from yesterday and you’ll notice a big difference not only in your mood but also your attention span. Doing the same tasks every day might seem boring, but it’s all about PMA — Positive Mental Attitude. If you tell yourself that you’re unhappy, then you’re unhappy. If you answer the phone with a smile and tell yourself you’re in a good mood, the customer will notice, and it may even help their own mood or attitude! We have all said to ourselves at one point or another “I can’t be bothered”. But we tell ourselves we can’t be bothered, no one else has told us to feel this way. It all comes down to how you want to feel, and if you want to feel in a better mood you truly can do that and it makes all the difference, not just for you and your mental health, but also for your fellow staff members and for your customers. So, as we conclude this task, I just want to say that I hope these tips are useful, and I hope that anyone else working in the same industry can relate to this. Trying to write 1000 words on a topic is daunting to say the least! But once I started, I was really on a roll. It actually made me think of the times that I’ve felt stuck in life, or at a dead end. Just pick yourself up and at least try to start a new day, week or hour. My time has run over, but at least I got to the word count. Thank you for having me on this test. I look forward to the next one.","The topic of today’s discussion will be techniques of effective call center management. This is a topic I have quite a bit of experience with so there will be quite a bit of information to impart. The first quality any call center manager needs to have is patience. This is because staffing and technical issues combined with complaints from consumers can make call centers stressful to manage. The ability to stay calm under pressure, and project that calming influence onto others is another key skill of effective call center managers. Staff members seek reassurance and leadership from their managers so you must always be prepared to render assistance. It is also crucial to have an understanding of the equipment you are using, so that you can quickly address any malfunctions. Time is of the essence in such cases, because every moment that passes with downed phones means angered consumers and losses for the company. Empathy is another vital skill, since staff will often seek help and advice from their managers. In addition, call center managers are expected to handle the most demanding customer complaints, defusing tensions as much as possible. Empathy and patience are paramount in these situations, as customers are often agitated and impatient. It is the manager’s duty to listen to and understand these consumers’ issues, and offer solutions as best you can. It is important not to take things said personally, as these consumers often vent their frustrations on the first voice they encounter. As the company’s foremost representative, you must conduct yourself in a professional manner in all dealings with staff and customers. You must be able to leave all other issues at home and always present a positive attitude at work. Customers can tell when you are in a bad mood, and do not care for it when you let a bad attitude show. One of the most important things to consider is attention to detail. This skill is absolutely critical to success, no matter the type of company you work for or the products and services they offer. Mistakes cost the company money, and while some mistakes are inevitable, it is imperative that they be noticed and addressed quickly. Even seemingly minor mistakes can end up costing the company or a consumer dearly so it is of the utmost importance that you double check all your work. Even if this process takes longer at first, it will end up saving you time in the long run by eliminating the need to go back and fix mistakes later. It must be reiterated that attention to detail is a crucial skill for effective call center managers to have. Passion is another quality that every effective manager must possess. Passion for your work is the key to becoming highly effective at it, and as a manager you should spread that passion to everyone around you. Passion is the key to happiness in your work, even if every day can’t be perfect. Solving customer issues in call center work can also be incredibly rewarding, especially since customers and staff will go above and beyond in their gratitude towards you. Many believe that call center work simply involves answering phones, but the reality is much deeper than that. You are your company’s first impression, you are the salesman and the voice of the company. There could be no “us” without you. I have worked in this business for many years and find it incredibly rewarding. It can be challenging, but that also keeps it interesting. You will need to embrace change and new routines in order to keep things interesting as well, otherwise you risk losing your passion. Shaking up routines by changing your greeting, or script (if applicable to your work), or offers. Simply changing up your routines can make big differences in your mood and attention span. Repeating the same tasks daily may seem boring, but everything comes down to keeping a Positive Mental Attitude (PMA). If you believe yourself to be unhappy, then you will be, but if, on the other hand, you answer the phone happily and tell yourself that you’re happy, then the customer will notice and may reciprocate. We have all felt over it all at some point or another, but that is simply the mood we allowed ourselves to have. It all comes down to choosing how you want to feel, and choosing a better mood can make big differences for yourself, your staff, and your customers. Now that this task is coming to an end, I express my hopes that you found these tips helpful, and that people in the industry find them relatable. It is quite an endeavor to write 1000 words about anything, but once I began, I felt that I really got into a rhythm. It even helped me to reflect on times I’ve felt challenged in life. You simply pick yourself up and begin each day, week, or hour, anew. I have now run out of time, but at least I hit the word count. I am very thankful to have been asked to participate in this test, and look forward to the next one.",Rephrase this text,paraphrase

"The next step to remember is that when you hear a siren, you must press the response buttons. There are two buttons: one on the front and one on the back. They must be pressed and released at the same time to be effective. The patient has approximately forty-five seconds to do so before treatment is administered. A siren indicates that an undesirable rhythm has been identified by the system that would warrant a treatment or shock to correct the arrhythmia. However, if an arrhythmia occurs, more than 95% of people become unconscious due to inadequate blood flow to the brain. If you are awake and alert, it is unlikely that an arrhythmia is occurring. Pushing the response buttons simultaneously will delay treatment. Some people get confused and wonder why they would delay a treatment if the monitor seems to indicate that something is wrong. It’s important for people to remember that there are other things that would cause the monitor’s alarm to go off  besides a fatal arrhythmia, including loose electrodes that are not making good contact with the skin. In these instances, treatment is not required. Always remember, if you hear a siren, press the response buttons.

There is no such thing as a request that is too much to handle, and this should be obvious by the look on your face. Customers are able to take mental note of non-verbal cues as well as how you speak. There’s a chance that the requests could be ridiculous, like “I request a pie without any pastry."" or “I’m aware this is a Singaporean establishment, but are there any meals that are not Singaporean, because I do not prefer it at all."" If I was to receive a dollar every time I received an idiotic request, I would be an extremely affluent woman. You are required to make believe their request is not idiotic, as if it is sincerely understandable. If you are not able to alleviate their problem, ask if you can provide something else to show that you have not entirely ignored their problems. With fine dining restaurants, customers look for a lot more compared to a bakery. They want to be greeted at the door. They want to be taken to their table straight away. For Heaven’s sake do not have them waiting. Those initial interactions are extremely important.","rewrite, reword and reorganize",paraphrase

These methods of fire-lighting date back to Paleolithic times, when some Stone Age tool-makers discovered that chipping flints produced sparkes. The technique became more efficient after the discovery of iron, about five thousand years ago. In North America, the Eskimos produced a slow-burning spark by striking quartz against iron pyrites, a compound that contains sulphur. The Chinese lit their fires by striking porcelain with bamboo. Tinder remained the main method of fire-lighting until the middle of the 19th century. Fire lighting was revolutionised by the discovery of phosphorus, isolated in 1669 by a German alchemist trying to transmute silver into gold.

When the tube was broken, air rushed in, causing the phosphorus to combust. Another device popular in the US was the Instantaneous Light Box — a bottle filled with the sulphuric acid, into which splints treated with chemicals were dipped.The first matches resembling those used today were made in 1827 by Walker.Walker was an English pharmacist who borrowed the formula from a military rocket-maker. Walker never patented his invention, and three years later, it was copied by Samuel Jones, who marketed his product as Lucifers. About the same time, a French chemistry student named Charles Sauria produced the first strike-anywhere match by substituting white phosphorus for the potassium chlorate in the Walker formula. However, since white phosphorus is a deadly poison, from 1845 match-makers exposed to its fumes succumbed to necrosis, a disease that eats away jaw bones. It was not until 1906 that the substance was eventually banned. That was about sixty-two years after a Swedish chemist called Pasch had discovered non-toxic red, or amorphous, phosphorus, a development exploited commercially by Pasch’s compatriot in 1885. This contained potassium chlorate, which has a combustion temperature of 182 degrees centigrade. America lagged behind Europe in match technology and safety standards. It was not until 1900 that the Diamond Match Company bought a fresh patent for safety — but it didn’t work in the different climatic conditions prevailing in the US, and it was another eleven years before scientists finally adapted the French patent for the US. The Americans can claim several firsts in match technology and marketing. In 1892, the Diamond Match Company pioneered book matches.

"There are various types of identity which show how a person fits into different situations. A personal identity is developed from our self-concept, how we perceive ourselves.

There is an observable self that is close to our true self, consisting of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours; however, the behaviours do not always align with thoughts and feelings. This is called cognitive dissonance, where our thoughts and actions aren’t in tune—our actions do not represent our feelings or vice versa.
