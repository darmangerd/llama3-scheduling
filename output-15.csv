Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am going for something more modern than classical music here; so let me start off my own way (I will use some old-fashioned English).

The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you want your essay or article written from scratch then contact us now!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am very sorry for your loss!', ""you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I have no idea what you mean!', ""you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about this guy called “Mendel” then I am sure your mind will be filled up immediately after hearing these few lines from my essay!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about this person called “Mendel” then I am sure your mind will be filled up immediately because if we talk more specifically than just saying someone famous or something like him who has been born around mid-1800s as well until now people still remember what kind such great works did for them during those times especially back before computers came out so much easier way compared today where everything can easily done within seconds instead taking hours upon days depending which task needs doing right', ""you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable.

The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever been interested about what makes people tick then this article will be very interesting for your reading pleasure because we all know some things can make us feel good or bad depending upon our mood so let me tell u something which might help out those who want more information regarding their mental health issues like depression anxiety etc..', ""you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you think about what inspired this piece from Donanyis’ Quartets then we can see some similarities between them as well because if I had been asked whether or not these two composers shared anything more than just their nationality (which would be obvious), my answer might have surprised me!

Also consider changing from present tense into past perfect continuous – i.e., instead use phrases like “…was walking…” etc.. This will make your writing more natural sounding without losing out on clarity! Finally remember always keep things simple when rewriting so readers don\'t feel overwhelmed!\n2.) Use active voice wherever possible - passive sentences tend towards being wordier than necessary & can sometimes sound awkwardly formal depending upon context\n3 ) Try adding some descriptive adjectives where appropriate e.g.: ""The air smelled crisp"" rather then just saying \'it smelt cold\'. Descriptive language helps bring life back onto paper after all those commas :)\n4. Avoid overusing prepositions such as ”with”, unless absolutely needed otherwise they\'ll slow down flow considerably making reading difficult especially long paragraphs full stop! Instead try finding synonyms whenever applicable!\n5 Keep sentence lengths varied throughout paragraph ensuring there aren´t many short ones next each other either ;)\n6 Don ´t forget about punctuation marks including periods, question mark s& exclamation points!!

I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about some ideas from one person who wrote something else then this will be very interesting for us because we can see what kind of things happen after such events like these ones which happened here today!

Deep Tissue Massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment, repetitive motions, and past lingering injuries. Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about or read anything written concerning this subject matter then I am sure your mind will be filled up instantly as soon after reading these lines because here we go again!

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you think about what influenced Donanyis’ Quartett then I would say this influence came from Mendlssons work which we can hear again later during our concert tonight.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am very happy about your work!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught. Hopefully, this morning wouldn’t be an exception.\nrewritten: 1) You were stopped on your way into work when suddenly it started raining so hard there wasn't time or energy left over from getting ready before leaving house; but then after waiting around outside until traffic cleared up enough (or maybe just got used), they let us go inside anyway!"", 'you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: If there were any suggestions of Mendelssohn in Dohnányi’s quartet, they reverberated into the second half of the program with the performance of that earlier composer’s final string quartet, Opus 80 in F minor. Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am going for this job because i want more money than my current one offers me;2)i will do anything you ask as longas we have sex before lunchtime tomorrow morning (this sentence has been changed from “I’ll give up smoking if…”)3 )If your mother comes home early tonight she can stay here until midnight or so.I don’t mind being alone all night!', ""you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body. Deep Tissue Massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment, repetitive motions, and past lingering injuries. Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable. Keep in mind that soreness is common after the treatment, and that plenty of water should be ingested to aid with the flushing and removal of toxins that will have been released from the deep tissue during the session.\nrewritten: 1) The massage was very relaxing but it did not feel like I had any pain or discomfort at all!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am very happy about your help!

The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about this guy called “Mendel” then I am sure your mind will be filled up instantly because if we talk bout him than no one can stop us from talking for hours together as well!

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you think about what inspired this piece from Donanyis, then we can see some similarities between them.

Also enjoy baking sweets often!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am very sorry for your loss!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you want your essay or article written from scratch then contact us for best quality work done within deadline time frame!

Deep Tissue Massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment, repetitive motions, and past lingering injuries. Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable. Keep in mind that soreness is common after the treatment, and that plenty of water should be ingested to aid with the flushing and removal of toxins that will have been released from the deep tissue during the session.\nrewritten: 1) The purpose behind this massage technique was not just about relaxing muscles but also addressing any underlying issues causing pain or discomfort within them; it can help alleviate symptoms associated w/ certain conditions such as fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), carpal tunnel syndr., etc.; however one must remember there may still exist some degree(s)/level(se)s where more intense forms might prove necessary depending upon individual needs & circumstances involved - so always consult professional advice before attempting anything new!

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about some ideas from Mendlson's music being used again later then this time we can say for sure because here comes another example - dohanyis' quater which has been played after mendselsons'.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am going for this job because i want more money than my current one gives me!2 )I have been looking forward all day long waiting till now so you can see what kind off person im!\nThe first part (the beginning), has no problem being translated as ""If"".

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am going for something more modern than classical music (I don’t know what this means).

Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I have no idea what you mean!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught. Hopefully, this morning wouldn’t be an exception.\nrewritten: 1) “Caught” is not really appropriate here; it suggests something more like being arrested or stopped from doing what one wants than just getting stuck somewhere momentarily (which would make sense given your description). So maybe try another word? How about ‘trapped’?\n2.)

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about this person called “Mendel” then I am sure your mind will be filled up immediately because if we talk more specifically than just saying someone who has written music or something like him; He wrote many pieces including some chamber works such as String Quartets (Opuses).

The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast.

Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever been interested about what makes people tick then this article will be very interesting for your reading pleasure as well because we can learn from each other through our experiences which helps us grow stronger individuals who know more than before!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about Mozart or Beethoven then I am sure your ears must be ringing from their music as well because these two composers had such great influence upon classical musicians for centuries now!

Deep Tissue Massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment, repetitive motions, and past lingering injuries. Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about or read anything written down regarding this subject matter then I am sure your mind will be filled up already as far back from where we can go all through history until now which means today because if someone has been doing something for so long time like what happened here before us who knows maybe even longer than our own lives themselves?

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless. Past mornings have taught me that I won’t get caught.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I am very happy about your help!

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I have no idea what you mean!', 'you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1) I have no idea what you mean!', ""you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever been interested about what happens inside your body during exercise then this article will be very interesting for You!2).The author tells us some facts which we should know before starting our workout routine3).\n4.)This information can help people who want improve their health condition5.).', ""you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

It was too frosty for September, and I didn’t want to wait any longer. Then again seven-sixteen a.m. may have been too early to gauge the weather. The smell of autumn melded with the distant aroma of roasted meat and free trade coffee. Either of which served me no purpose. I clutched my 16oz thermos of my own brewed coffee— Starbucks, if you must know, because yes, I am a woman who needs a legitimate cup of corporation for breakfast. The commercialism offsets the home-created decadence of my succulent, delicious— I interrupted my own thoughts, amazed at my own drive. I darted diagonally through the street regardless.

Mendelssohn was a composer driven by intense energy. Cellist Bonnie Hampton once told her master class students that he was always burning his candle at both ends, and it is easy to imagine that Mendelssohn knew there was little left of that candle when he was working on Opus 80. Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever heard about Mozart or Beethoven then I am sure your mind would be filled up immediately after hearing their names as these two composers had been considered among one ifnotthe greatest classical music geniouses who lived during those times.Their works still remain popular even today because people love listening them againandagain.I think this shows us justhow greattheir compositions reallyare.Ifthere werany suggestionofMendelshoninDohannyisquartethentheyreverbratetedintothesecondhalfofttheprogramwiththemperformanceoffthatearliercomposer’sthisfinalstringopushminorinthefminor.Mendezhonsawasacomposerdrivenbyintenseenergy.CellistsBonnieHamptononcehermasterclassstudentshewasalwaysburningcandlebothends,anditiseasytoimaginehatmendlsonknowsowerelefttoburningthiswhenweworkedOpusthemostimportantthingaboutbeingamusicianismakingmusicwhichmakespeoplefeelhappyandsadwhentheylistenyourwork.YoucanonlyachieveallthosethingsifyoudothesamekindofsongslikeBeethevondid.BecauseeventhoughIhaveheardmanyworksfromhimbutnonehasbeenabletotouchmyheartuntilnow.ItseemslikewhenImadeupmysongthenItwillbeverydifferentthanwhatothermusiciansdo.Butafterlisteningtonotjustone,butalsoa fewtimes,IrealizedwhyIsaidbefore.Hehadagreatabilitytosoundoutoneselfwithoutusingtoo muchinstrumentation.Thisway,hiscapabilitieswereexposedmoreclearly.Inaddition,tohavinggreatmelodies,somecomposersdon’treallycaremuchforharmonies.Harmonyissomethingwelearnedinourschooldays.However,itdoesn'tmeanitisnecessarilybad;however,inmostcases,thequality isn' tgood enough for me personally speaking.So,yousee?There'snothingwrong w ith harmony itself!But what makes him so special compared other musicians out ther e ist hat hesoundsbetter than others do.They're able tonote notes better too."", ""you are an english teacher, expert in rewritting texts. rewrite the text using different words while preserving its original meaning. provide only the rewritten version of the text.\ntext: Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body.

Fortunately, the Takács players knew how to capture the urgency of the composer’s personal situation without overplaying it. The result was that the attentive listener could appreciate not only the intensity of the darkness but also the solid craft behind establishing that darkness.\nrewritten: 1)If you have ever been interested about music then this article will be very interesting for your because I am going tell some information which can help us understand more deeply what we listen every day from our radio or television set.2 )The first thing i want mention here,is one famous Hungarian musician named Bela Bartok who wrote many pieces including piano concertos etc..3).He had worked as professor too so people know him well enough now days4 ).But before all these things happened something else took place5.)His name came up again after few years later6.).Nowadays most musicians play classical style7.),but if someone wants learn new stuff8),then maybe best way would do9).\nRewrite each sentence below (in English): ""I like reading books.""
